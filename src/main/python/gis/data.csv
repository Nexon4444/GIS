It has been pointed out that one of the main uncertainty contributions in such links is related to insufficient stabilization of the lasers' wavelengths and to the asymmetry of propagation caused by the fiber's chromatic dispersion. To reduce these contributions, we propose a scheme where the difference (offset) of the wavelengths of forward and backward lasers is stabilized and where optical interleavers are used as diplexers. This allows implementing a λ-swapping tech-nique to assess dispersion-related link asymmetry during the link calibration. For the investigation of these approaches and the measurement of the associated stability we utilize a frequency-synchronized offset laser module (FSOLM) to realize an offset of 25 GHz. In this paper, we show that with the proposed λ-swapping technique the uncertainty associated with the propaga-tion asymmetry due to fiber chromatic dispersion can be reduced to values below 2.5 ps for links up to 1000 km long, making it insignificant compared to other uncertainty contributions. A laboratory proof-of-concept experiment, in which distances up to 540 km were tested, showed good agreement between the meas-ured and the anticipated propagation delay of investigated links.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.2999158","Narodowe Centrum Nauki; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9105070","fiber optic;time transfer;calibration uncertainty;laser wavelength stabilization;interleaver filter","","","","","","","CCBY","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In such cases one of the possibilities is to display the adaptive content on a dedicated road sign. The most important issue in the process of building the trust between the road signalling infrastructure and the end user is the information significance and its value. The ongoing NCBiR project - InZnak - aims to introduce a new type of the road signalling subsystem which relies on intelligent road signs equipped with variety of sensors and adaptive led displays. Sensors feed the autonomous algorithms with data necessary to take decisions on how to react to current road conditions. The proposed system typically consists of a few road signs communicating with each other and exchanging measured data: weather conditions, road surface condition, traffic volume, avg. vehicles speed, detected road events, etc. On the basis of the information exchanged between road signs, each of them runs the autonomous algorithm to process that data and computes the current status of road section driving conditions. The InZnak project focuses on the problem of the traffic control using intelligent autonomous road signs. The process of the speed limit determination is often complicated and in many cases it is defined by numerous legal standards. In general, speed determination should take into account not only the technical aspect, but also social and legal aspects, which makes this process especially difficult. This paper presents the InZnak communication system architecture with the deployed prototype and its current status of integration.","","978-1-5386-9484-8","10.1109/MTITS.2019.8883382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883382","intelligent road sign;traffic moderation;intelligent transport system;ITS communications","Roads;Wireless communication;Intelligent sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Standards;Protocols","intelligent transportation systems;law;LED displays;road traffic;road vehicles","road signalling subsystem;autonomous algorithm;weather conditions;road surface condition;intelligent autonomous road signs;InZnak communication system architecture;intelligent transportation systems;road signalling infrastructure;ongoing NCBiR project;sensors;led displays;legal standards;social aspects","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are a few ways to realize perpendicularly magnetized MTJ, which are characterized by greater thermal stability than their in-plane magnetized counterparts. Taking advantage of the interface anisotropy yields the best results, especially in terms of high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) measured typically in MTJs with CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB trilayer. Recent studies on perpendicular MTJ resulted in the TMR ratio exceeding 200 % [1] thanks to careful optimization of both the free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) structure. We report on the perpendicular MTJ with a composite CoFeB/W/CoFeB FL [2,3] which is characterized by high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and spin polarization resulting in up to 180 % TMR measured at room temperature and above 280 % TMR at low temperature. The multilayers with the following structure were deposited: buffer / SyF / spacer / CoFeB(1) / MgO(1.2) / CoFeB(tFL) / W(0.3) / CoFeB(0.5) / MgO(1) / capping (thicknesses in nm), with tFL ranging from 1 up to 1.6 nm and RA product equal to 10 Ωμm2. For the 1.5 nm thick CoFeB sublayer, the TMR of 180 % at room temperature and 280 % at 20 K was measured. The stability diagram was modeled based on Ref. [4]. Additionally, it was assumed that in-plane all (out-of-plane al) torque component scales linearly (quadratically) with the applied current [5]. To account for additional physical effects that contribute to the stability diagram, namely VCMA and temperature effect, the coercive field HC is scaled by the factor: HC = HK(1-VKV-(T/ kT)1/2) where V is the applied voltage, HK is the anisotropy field, VK is the VCMA coefficient and Ta is the ambient temperature. kT represents the dependence of the temperature on the coercive field. The damping factor was measured independently by the broadband FMR technique. An increase of the TMR from 140% for tFL = 1.1 nm up to TMR = 180% for tFL = 1.5 nm is explained by an increase of the spin polarization for thicker ferromagnetic layer. A rapid reduction of the TMR for tFL = 1.6 nm is caused by the transition of the FL magnetization vector to the sample plane. Electronic transport properties were measured in perpendicular magnetic field (see Fig. 1). It has been already established that apart from the conventional STT effect in MTJs with a relatively thin MgO barrier, the switching process can be also affected by the VCMA effect in a thin FL. To investigate the switching process in more detail, we repeated the R(V) loops measurement, with different constant magnetic field. The stability diagram was obtained in this way both at low (T = 20 K) and room temperature (T = 300 K) for the MTJ with tFL = 1.1 nm. The 300 K result is presented in Fig. 2. The diagram was modelled using STT, VCMA and thermal effects taken into account. In addition, for the precise derivation of the STT coefficients, the magnetization damping was calculated based on an independent FMR measurement. Fitting the experimental stability diagram to the model yielded the temperature coefficients of kT = 0.0014 T/K. This parameter was kept constant for MTJs with different tFL. Remaining parameters of the stability diagrams for each tFL were modeled independently. For tFL = 1.1 nm, the following STT components were obtained: all = 0.024 T/V and al = 0.02 T/V, however, we note that the modeled stability diagram is insensitive to al, which agrees with another macrospin approach based on Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation presented in Ref. [6]. In-plane torque τll was thereafter recalculated and as the result we obtained τll = 4.5*10-19 Nm/V, which agrees well with literature values of STT in the case of an in-plane MTJ [5,7]. Regarding VCMA, the best results for MTJ with tFL = 1.1 nm were obtained for VK = 0.14 1/V. Based on the following relation: VK = κ/μ0HCMStFLtB, where tB = 1.2 nm is the tunnel barrier thickness, VCMA coeficient of κ = 77 fJ/ Vm was calculated, which fits well commonly measured values for CoFeB/ MgO devices [3,8].

The novel CSA feedback, with the effective resistance of 0.6 GΩ and sets of switches, allows for sensor leakage current compensation up to tens of nA, fast return to the CSA output baseline even in the case of the high frequency of input pulses, and low noise operation. The measured equivalent noise charge is only 60 e- rms, while an offset spread is 9.4 e- rms. These parameters allow to count and distinguish photons in each pixel independently, even if the difference between photons’ energies is only 0.86 keV. Having in mind future synchrotron applications, the several readout schemes of the pixel matrix are implemented. The continuous readout mode allows for 70 kfps frame rate.

This paper presents the analog and digital design plus the measured functional and characterization results. Key design goals were optimization to GEM charge characteristics maximizing signal to noise, timing resolution and operation at high particle rate. There are 128 front-end channels comprising preamplifier, shaper and constant fraction discriminator (CFD). Features include programmable polarity (for use with gaseous MPGD or silicon detectors), programmable gain (for linearity 9.5 fC, 28 fC and 55 fC) and programmable shaping times (15 ns, 25 ns, 36 ns and 45 ns), plus the CFD reducing time walk to less than 0.4 ns within 3 fC to 30 fC of input charge, optimizing timing resolution. An internal calibration circuit allows calibration of each channel with ""GEM like"" or ""Silicon like"" input pulses, each having programmable amplitude, polarity and phase. The ENC measures 620 e + 33 e/pF in high gain. The hit rate capability is demonstrated to 2 MHz per channel. VFAT3 has 2 output paths; the first (Trigger Path) provides hit information for every LHC clock cycle. The second (Data Path) provides data packets upon receipt of a trigger, each data packet contains hit information and time stamps. The chip can operate with trigger latencies up to 25.6 μs and is capable of receiving consecutive triggers. VFAT3 can operate with up to 2 MHz trigger rate in default mode and has data packet zero suppression capabilities to go beyond this rate. An internal dedicated Comm-Port allows communication to and from the chip. Additional features include channel input protection, internal/external temperature measurement and design for a radiation environment.

While SDN promises to simplify network management and monitoring processes, there are still numerous issues to address. Many of them involve the centralized network controller, depicted as a single point of failure able to make the whole network down in case of misconfiguration or unavailability. The SDN controller is typically involved in monitoring tasks that require uninterrupted connectivity with network nodes. Maintenance of up-to-date network state database generates frequent data transfers over the control channel and significant resource consumption. The both inevitably affect performance of other tasks. Considering such circumstances, it is desirable to find a tradeoff between measurements accuracy and the related overhead in terms of network and computational resources. In this paper, the Slotted Flow Stats Acquisition (SFSA) mechanism is proposed. Its aim is to spread in time the control channel load caused by network monitoring tasks, preventing the controller from being affected by resource consumption bursts. The mechanism may be adjusted to user-specific needs regarding desired accuracy of the periodically gathered measurement data. It is shown that the proposed solution effectively eliminates traffic spikes caused by requests for bulk flow statistics. Controller responsiveness in OpenFlow-based networks is thus improved.","2325-2626","978-1-5386-9223-3","10.1109/ICCNC.2019.8685581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685581","","","software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","Slotted Flow Stats Acquisition mechanism;control channel load;network monitoring tasks;resource consumption bursts;bulk flow statistics;controller responsiveness;resource-efficient Flow statistics polling;OpenFlow networks;Software Defined Networking architecture;commercial contexts;network management;monitoring processes;centralized network controller;misconfiguration;SDN controller;uninterrupted connectivity;network nodes;up-to-date network state database;significant resource consumption;computational resources;data transfers","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These patterns are often modeled with averaged driver model. While this idea is very simple and intuitive in the context of driver classification by his/her patterns of maneuvers, our previous works demonstrated that assumptions underlying such models are often inaccurate and not applicable in general settings. In fact, it is very hard to express driving patterns with simple models. In this article we present a new way of modeling drivers: we employ Long-Short Term Memory networks to learn driver models from telematics data. In particular, our neural network models learn to predict driving-related signals, such as speed or acceleration, given the evolution of these signals up to the point of prediction. Solving this prediction task allows us to capture the behavioral model of the driver. We tested our models on several drivers, by predicting their future decisions. By learning our models on one driver and then evaluating them on another driver, we demonstrate that LSTM models are a powerful tool for driver profiling and detection of abnormal situations. We also evaluate the influence of data preprocessing on the quality of predictions. In this context we use Kalman filering, which can remove noise from uncertain dynamic measurements, in effect giving the best linearly estimated data.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500715","","Vehicles;Smart phones;Predictive models;Noise measurement;Data models;Load modeling;Engines","driver information systems;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;signal classification;traffic engineering computing","driver profiling;driver behavior;driver classification;Long-Short Term Memory networks;neural network models;LSTM models;LSTM networks;Kalman filtering","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That approach cuts down electronic element count, decreases size and price of the inverter and reduces power losses. However, at the same time it can also give rise to an undesired phenomenon of a spontaneous synchronisation (locking) between the motor rotational speed and the PWM frequency. An inverter-motor drive system may behave like an unintended phase-locked loop (PLL), endeavouring to keep a constant ratio between the six-step commutation frequency and the PWM modulation frequency. Resulting nonlinearity, discontinuity, hysteresis and nonuniqueness of the drive unit mechanical characteristic makes it difficult to develop a controller algorithm.

The grid-connected 3-phase NPC inverter is powered via the split DC-link composed of the capacitive divider (Fig. 1). It enables the usage of two DC-buses independently which can be supplied by the separated boost-type DC-DC converters. They are used to generate the maximal power value (MPP) from each string of PV modules. The main objective of this paper is the analysis of a DC-link voltage unbalance effect and development of dedicated balancing control algorithm based on the 7-segment space vector modulation method (SVM). The goal of proposed solution is proper operation of the three-phase NPC inverter under permanent input PV power unbalance (|ΔPdc| > 0). In the presented paper the maximal permissible level of input power unbalance was estimated which can be compensated by the use of developed NPC inverter modulation method as a function of instantaneous operation point (e.g. amplitude modulation index maSVM).

The operation of the converter is based on the principle of a switched-capacitor voltage multiplier (SCVM) but the utilization of the components is very effective in the proposed idea, because the converter is able to charge two output capacitors with only one additional switch and a diode. An important benefit of the proposed converter is that the gate circuits do not require isolated supply and all the switches utilize bootstrap supply. The converter can be designed with air-based or planar PCB-type chokes. Therefore, it can achieve low weight, low volume, decreased cost and simplified assembling. The voltage stress on two switches is close to only half of the output voltage. The stresses on the other switches are much lower, which is very favorable.

Various modes propagating with different velocities can be confused and erroneously treated as damage reflected components. Both S0 and A0 Lamb modes exhibit elliptical polarization, therefore, their in-plane and out-of plane motion components are shifted by ± 90°. Also, the ratios of in-plane and out-of-plane displacements between these components vary and the direction of particle motion is opposite for both modes. Using a 3D scanning laser vibrometer it is possible to capture the in-plane and out-of-plane motion. The modes differ not only in polarization parameters but also in group velocities, therefore, normally they are well separated in time. Two modes can occur simultaneously only close to the wave source or to a defect that leads to mode conversion. Since the in-plane and out-of plane motion components are generally out-of-phase, a comparison of these components permits detection of mode conversion, which leads to superior and reliable damage detection. Here, we present a damage imaging method based on mode-conversion indicator (MCI).","1948-5727","978-1-5386-3383-0","10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8092957","Lamb waves;mode-conversion;3D laser scanning vibrometer","Vibrations;Three-dimensional displays;Measurement by laser beam;Laser modes;Vibrometers;Transducers;Vibration measurement","condition monitoring;measurement by laser beam;plates (structures);structural engineering;surface acoustic waves;vibration measurement","lamb wave signals;A0 lamb modes;out-of-plane motion;3D scanning laser;particle motion;out-of-plane displacements;elliptical polarization;damage reflected components;multimodal nature;3D laser vibrometer;mode-conversion sensing;plate-like structures;mode-conversion indicator;damage imaging method;reliable damage detection;superior damage detection;plane motion components;mode conversion","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such, the Northbound interface of SDN networks which ensures communication with external applications requires particularly close attention. In this paper we propose the Risk Assessment and Management approach to SEcure SDN (RAMSES). This novel solution is able to estimate the risk associated with traffic demand requests received via the Northbound-API in SDN networks. RAMSES quantifies the impact on network cost incurred by expected traffic demands and specifies the likelihood of adverse requests estimated using the reputation system. Accurate risk estimation allows SDN network administrators to make the right decisions and mitigate potential threat scenarios. This can be observed using extensive numerical verification based on an network optimization tool and several scenarios related to the reputation of the sender of the request. The verification of RAMSES confirmed the usefulness of its risk assessment approach to protecting SDN networks against threats associated with the Northbound-API.","2325-2626","978-1-5386-9223-3","10.1109/ICCNC.2019.8685486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685486","security;SDN;risk assessment;Northbound-API","","application program interfaces;computer network management;computer network security;risk management;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","risk assessment approach;secure Northbound interface;RAMSES;traffic demand requests;Northbound-API;network cost;accurate risk estimation;SDN network administrators;network optimization tool","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The self-designed single-mode generator is constructed in the form of a matrix of acoustic monopoles and is capable to generate a selected single mode. The scattering matrix formalism is a new approach to analyse the acoustical systems containing one or more duct-like elements (joints) connected by some undefined elements such as, for example, acoustic mufflers of different types and so the formalism is frequently applied to analyse the phenomena of noise reduction in such systems. Experimental derivation of the scattering matrix for a wave composed of N modes demands, in general, excitation of N different sound fields at each side of the two-port first. Finally the matrix composed of the modal pressures measurements obtained for each of the exited fields must be inversed to obtain the scattering matrix. Generating single N modes the matrix of the incoming pressure data is, theoretically, diagonal which makes derivation of the scattering matrix much easier. Generation of independent sound fields in the shape of single modes ensures the matrix to be well conditioned.","","978-1-5386-7114-6","10.1109/ACOUSTICS.2018.8502405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502405","circular duct;multimode wave;two-port approach;muffler;scattering matrix;single-mode generator","Ducts;Scattering;Acoustics;Exhaust systems;Junctions;Generators;Shape","acoustic field;acoustic noise;acoustic signal processing;acoustic wave propagation;acoustic wave transmission;silencers;S-matrix theory","single-mode generator;acoustic monopoles;scattering matrix formalism;acoustical systems;acoustic mufflers;multimode wave propagation;acoustic two-port scattering matrix;independent sound fieldduct-like elements;noise reduction","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the crucial elements is an anode that, typically, is a composite of nickel and yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ). The microstructure morphology of an anode plays an important role in determining the electrochemical performances of a single cell and, consequently, a stack of cells. Therefore, the microstructure optimization design should be included in the development of a system at a very early stage. The anode material microstructure can be tailored to fulfill the role it has at the particular location in the stack. This paper presents a novel approach of using an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the microstructure of an SOFC's anode. The optimization problem consists of 16 microstructural parameters connected by the mesh of the dependencies. One group of algorithms that can face this challenge is an evolutionary algorithm family. In this paper, a genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimization are employed to optimize the cell microstructure and to help in improving the performance of an SOFC. The developed mathematical model can correctly predict the performance of the SOFC anode and is employed in the evolutionary algorithms to select the optimal microstructure.

The measurement set-up consists of a self-designed single mode synthesizer located inside anechoic termination and a measuring section with the microphone moving along the waveguide radius. Several measurement series were carried out for each of the generated consecutive single modes, i.e. (0,0), (1,1), (2,1), (0,1) and a frequency wideband signal for an axisymmetrical and non - axisymmetrical position of a single sound source. For each case, calculations of the mean value and the type A standard uncertainty were executed by means of the classical method but also by the bootstrap estimate of the mean value and the bootstrap estimation of the uncertainty. The results obtained applying each of the listed methods were discussed and compared with each other. The non-zero result of the standard deviation indicates some eccentricity in the measurement set - up and so it can serve as a hint to improve axiality of the system.","","978-1-5386-7114-6","10.1109/ACOUSTICS.2018.8502307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502307","acoustic duct;single modes;measurement errors","Acoustic measurements;Acoustics;Biomedical measurement;Pressure measurement;Standards;Ducts;Uncertainty","acoustic generators;acoustic intensity measurement;acoustic radiators;measurement errors;pressure measurement","waveguide radius;frequency wideband signal;single sound source;bootstrap estimate;in-duct acoustic pressure measurement errors;anechoic termination;single mode synthesizer;sound sources;duct axis;bootstrap estimation","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most common types of this disease is renal cancer, occurring in kidneys. A total of 63,340 new renal cancer cases (42,680 in men and 22,660 in women) and 14,970 deaths from renal cancer (10,010 men and 4,960 women) are projected to occur only in the US in 2018, with 1 in 48 lifetime risk for developing kidney cancer for men and 1 in 83 for women. Tumor growth is a complex, multiscale phenomena with many coupled microscopic and macroscopic factors that have to be accounted for while studying the disease. Despite a tremendous amount of work on understanding cancerogenesis and developing an effective anticancer therapies we still do not fully understand the mechanics of the malignant tissue development. Even though it is impossible to fully simulate and control cancer growth, numerical model allows for identification and investigation of the most crucial tumor growth factors and possible scenarios of its proliferation. The purpose of this article is to create model of renal tumor that uses the particle automata model[1,2]. We would also like to clarify if smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method can be used to improve modelling of this particular biological process[3]. In the particle automata model both cancerous and healthy tissues are made of particles interacting with each other via spring harmonic forces and in SPH model we assume that biological tissues are represented as viscous fluids. In each model healthy tissue serves as an environment in which the renal tumor develops. Both healthy and cancerous cells have a life cycle in which they can be proliferating, dormant or necrotic. We use oxygen concentration, external pressure and time as restrictive factors for tissue growth. Herein we hope to reproduce in vivo tumor growth results inside in silico model and gain more insight into the rules governing the spread of the disease.","","978-1-5386-6143-7","10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8388368","renal;cancer;modeling;particle automata;SPH;simulation","Tumors;Cancer;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Viscosity;Automata;Blood vessels","cancer;cellular biophysics;kidney;patient treatment;tumours","in vivo tumor growth;in silico model;effective anticancer therapy;tumor growth factors;biological process;spring harmonic forces;biological tissues;viscous fluids;oxygen concentration;smooth particle hydrodynamics method;numerical model;cancer growth;malignant tissue development;macroscopic factors;coupled microscopic factors;kidney cancer;morbidity;cancer mortality rate;renal cancer progression;particle automata model;disease;tissue growth;cancerous cells;healthy cells;renal tumor;SPH model;healthy tissues;cancerous tissues","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The TSVs in the ROCs enable a vertical routing of their peripheral IOs to the back side where they are spread to a land grind array (LGA) with 800 μm pitch. Thus, the back side of the ROCs can be used for next level interconnection to LTCC system boards which allows a pure vertical system architecture. With this routing concept, area-consuming wire bond connections from the peripheral IOs of the ROCs to the system board can be avoided which is the base for edgeless detector configurations with a tiled assembly of ROCs without imaging dead zones. To enable the envisioned vertical system concept, the ROCs were post-processed with 100 μm deep copper filled TSVs, front and back side redistribution, micro solder bumps for connection to the detector and land grid array (LGA) for connection to the system board. The UFXC32k (Ultra Fast X-ray Chip with 32k channels) served as ROC device featuring an array of 32768 pixel IOs using a pitch of 75 mm, 87 peripheral chip IOs and a total size of 2 cm2. The sensor tiles were post-processed with copper pads to enable a side by side flip chip assembly of two ROCs onto each sensor. The LGAs on the back side of the ROCs were used to mount the sub-modules to the LTCC system boards, which were pre-assembled with SMDs and corresponding solder ball arrays. The fabricated 3D hybrid pixel modules show a good electrical performance and passed real X-ray imaging experiments. A high interconnect yield was achieved with only maximum 17 dead pixels out of 65536 total pixels per detector.

A principal cause of vibration is unbalance of rotors due to either fabrication inaccuracies or operational factors. Unbalance leads to excessive wear on bearings and causes premature failures. Most common method to return the rotating element to a balanced condition is applying corrective masses at certain locations [1, 2]. Proposed methodology is based on unique Balancing System utilizing fluid as a corrective mass. In this work, we present a simulation of fluid flow through a designed device of the active balancing of rotors with correction mass (liquid).

Therefore, the compensation technique is proposed allowing for equalisation of the differential coupling coefficients by adding appropriate compensating elements to the per-unit-length capacitance and inductance matrices of the coupled-line section. The proposed approach allows for realisation of quasi-ideal differential coupled-line couplers designed in arbitrarily chosen dielectric stack-up, and almost for arbitrarily chosen coupling.

In particular, detection of low-latency spikes from directly activated neurons at the stimulating electrodes remains virtually impossible. We tested a new idea for artifact reduction, based on an optimized correction pulse applied to the stimulating electrode instantly after the stimulation pulse. The correction pulse is expected to generate its own artifact compensating the remaining artifact resulting from the stimulation pulse. We verified the model in numerical simulations using realistic model of the electrode impedance and schematic of our new CMOS integrated circuit dedicated to electrical stimulation and recording of neuronal activity. We analyzed the artifact level at the output of the recording amplifier to take into account its filtering properties.

The investigations of thermoelectric properties, i.e.: electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient and the thermal conductivity, were carried out in the temperature range from RT to 910 K. On the basis of the experimental data, the temperature dependencies of the thermoelectric Figure of merit ZT were calculated. Detailed analysis of all obtained results was performed withadditional insight into the role of the synthesis method on received thermoelectric properties. Superionic thermoelectric materials based on Cu2 X (X = S, Se, Te) are intensively studied in recent years due to the very high values of their ZT parameter [1]. Unfortunately, their transport properties are unstable becouse of the high mobility of copper ions [2].

The proposed solution is based on the central controller, which enhances an operation of particular mechanisms which compose the integrated system. The key mechanisms of the system allow to solve the problems of congestion and traffic engineering when failures occur in a network. In particular, they ensure fast acceptance of priority traffic, even in congestion, and protect such flows when a link fails in a network. Moreover, an intelligent routing algorithm for FAN allows to increase the total amount of transmitted traffic in a network. However, the mentioned mechanisms implemented alone have some drawbacks. They are eliminated in the integrated solution. The system proposed in this paper is a novel approach, which was not considered for FAN so far.

Due to the normalized procedures the extension of the tests with lightning voltage impulse have to consider voltage impulses chopped after different time. This specific tests are suggested for transformers which are directly connected to GIS substations by means of oil to SF6 bushings or when the power transformer is protected by rod gaps. Due to actual standardized tests for transformers with nominal voltages below 170 kV chopped wave lightning voltages impulses are described as special tests. For Power Transformers with nominal voltages higher than 170 kV chopped wave lightning voltages impulse are performed as an routine tests. While chopped voltage impulse tests, applied wave of lightning impulse should be chopped after time which is between 3μs and 6 μs. The plan of analysis presented in this article cover measurements of overvoltages appearing inside transformer windings while normalized voltage tests conducted with full wave lightning voltage impulse and chopped impulses after time to chopping in the range from 1 μs up to 50 μs.

As a partial remedy for this, refined Isogeometric Analysis (rIGA) method improves the sequential execution of direct solvers. The refinement strategy enriches traditional highly-continuous Cp-1 IGA spaces by introducing low-continuity C0-hyperplanes along the boundaries of certain pre-defined macro-elements. In this work, we propose a solution strategy for rIGA for parallel distributed memory machines and compare the computational costs of solving rIGA versus IGA discretizations.

Wide range of these applications usually employ one-way shape memory effect and superelasticity. Special properties of SMA are due to thermoelastic phase transformation phenomenon. During these transformations elastic modulus and energy dissipation properties in these smart alloys are changing. This phenomenon of changing SMA properties gets us possibility of applaying them in controlled vibration isolation systems. Such systems could change their properties and could adapt to current changing working conditions. By using SMA we could build smart vibrating systems.

In such a link for its optimal performance, the gains of the bidirectional optical amplifiers need to be adjusted to minimize the noise resulting from Rayleigh backscattering and amplified spontaneous emission. A model of the link is proposed using a transmission matrixes approach, which allows estimating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the ends of the main link (i.e., connecting the end terminals) and at the extraction (tapping) nodes located along the main link. The transmission matrixes of a fiber span and Er-doped fiber amplifier are presented and required formulas are derived. In addition, wavelength selective isolators are considered, which allow intentional breaking of the propagation of backscattered signals and are effective in improving the SNR when long fiber spans are involved.

The results may be useful for the characterization of soil particularly when its optimum utilizations are inclined towards agriculture. This is so vital because soil compaction results into its degradation and hence plants which depend solely on it for existence are affected. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Ground Conductivity Meter (GCM) methods of geophysical measurements are considered for this evaluation. The choice of GPR is informed by its non-invasiveness, simplicity and swiftness while the GCM was chosen as complimentary to the former. The method of estimating soil properties based on GPR data consists in searching for signal attributes, such as the amplitude of reflected radar waves, phase or envelope, which provide information on the continuity and/or discontinuity of reflections in the examined layer, geometries of spatial soil structures and their characteristics. Field measurements were carried out on a student's pilot field of WIPiE University of Agriculture, Krakow in three variants of soil compaction with tractor wheels. It should be emphasized that the compaction was carried out separately for each series of measurements. GCM and cone penetrating meter were also used for measurement at the same profile. Results of the three approaches of measurement have shown the possibility of identifying the zones of compaction and hence the degradation to the soil. The other methods results also show similarity in the delineation of the compacted zones. The comparison of methods used gave satisfactory correlations. Thus characterization of soil using these approaches is possible and the outcome information is very useful for professional such as soil scientist.","","978-83-88131-00-4","10.23919/PTZE.2019.8781709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8781709","Soil;rheological property;compaction;geophysical methods;cone penetrometer","Soil;Compaction;Ground penetrating radar;Geophysical measurements;Soil measurements;Conductivity;Agricultural machinery","agriculture;geophysical techniques;ground penetrating radar;soil","tractor wheels;Krakow;WIPiE University of Agriculture;signal attributes;GCM method;soil characterization;EM conductivity methods;ground conductivity meter methods;soil compaction;ground penetrating radar;soil scientist;cone penetrating meter;field measurements;spatial soil structures;reflected radar waves;GPR data;soil properties;geophysical measurements;integrated geophysical methods;rheological properties;rheological structure","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, the training set in incomplete, and some troughs correctly found by the network are regarded as false detections, so training is ineffective. We proposed interactive completion of the data set in the training process, and this was crucial for proper training of the network. We developed two alternative systems. The first is based on single-shot detection (SSD) architecture with a VGG network, which achieved an area-under-curve (AUC) value of 0.89. The second, based on TinyYOLOv2, had an AUC value of 0.87 but was more than 10 times faster.

Their proper identification based on standard preoperative CT images is still not a fully solved problem. Therefore, we decided to resolve this issue by providing a tree topology model using post-mortem kidneys. The number of vessels that compose intrarenal tree is so large, that it cannot by analyzed manually without the aid of image processing techniques. So that, the vessels has to be first depicted using an imaging technique that enables to provide superior resolution in comparison to standard CT scan. In this paper, we present a research on various injection materials enabling to fill the vascular beds in order to scan them using micro-CT and further reconstruct as a 3D model. The evaluated materials were chosen so that they are widely available and affordable. We compare them in terms of their ability to absorb ionizing radiation and penetrate vascular beds (density, viscosity), homogeneity, solidification rate, resistance to solvents and durability. We also present the technique of injecting kidney arteries with the use of the selected material two-part epoxy adhesive with 10% iodine. In contrast to standard corrosive endocast preparation, in our case there is no need to remove soft parenchymal tissue which takes about two weeks using corrosive materials such as strong acids and bases. The proposed filling material enables to enhance vascular tree to such extend that micro-CT scans of the whole kidneys can be performed. This enables instantaneous substance injection and imaging without permanently destroying the soft tissue material. This approach can be used in various scenarios in which a filling material with the ability to increase radiation absorption is required and there is a need to maintain the integrity of the structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such attempt. The obtained vascular trees by the means of micro-CT confirm the validity of the presented approach.","1558-2809","978-1-5386-6628-9","10.1109/IST.2018.8577164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8577164","micro-CT;3D vascular tree;kidney;injection materials;cast;contrast agents;ability to absorb ionizing radiation;kidney surgery;minimally invasive surgery.","Kidney;Filling;Surgery;Arteries;Standards;Needles;Ionizing radiation","blood vessels;computerised tomography;image reconstruction;image resolution;kidney;medical image processing;solidification","renal surgeries;preoperative determination;standard preoperative CT images;tree topology model;post-mortem kidneys;intrarenal tree;image processing techniques;imaging technique;injection materials;vascular beds;kidney arteries;corrosive materials;strong acids;filling material;microCT scans;instantaneous substance injection;soft tissue material;vascular trees;intrarenal arterial tree;minimally invasive approach;two-part epoxy adhesive;computed tomography;3D model;ionizing radiation;solidification rate","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite recent research and the availability of many blogs and tutorials devoted to these topics, few reports on real-world implementations exist that provide experimental insight into their scalability. To bridge this gap, researchers developed an architecture that exploits both CQRS and ES in accordance with Reactive Manifesto guidelines. Using that architecture, they implemented a prototype interactive flight-scheduling application to investigate this approach's scalability. A performance evaluation in a cloud environment of 15 virtual machines demonstrated the CQRS and ES patterns' horizontal scalability, observed independently for the application's read and write models. This article explains how to assemble this type of architecture, first on a conceptual level and then with specific technologies including Akka, Cassandra, Kafka, and Neo4J.

The use of multiple level crossings is a fundamental paradigm for the recently investigated event-based sampling approach. In fact, level crossings allows us to exploit local signal properties and to avoid unnecessarily fast sampling when the local signal intensity is low. The paper proposes the least-square based method for the local intensity estimation from level crossings for the class of signals being the time-warped version of the stationary and bandlimited Gaussian processes. This result is then related to the concept of the local mean bandwidth and finally to the local power bandwidth. The smooth convolution estimate of the local intensity is proposed and its positivity corrected version is introduced. The latter is achieved by the truncation argument and next by the method of alternating projections onto convex sets.","","978-1-5386-1565-2","10.1109/SAMPTA.2017.8024457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024457","","Radar","Gaussian processes;least squares approximations;signal reconstruction;signal sampling","bandwidth estimation;stochastic signals;local bandwidth recovery;multiple level crossings;event-based sampling;least-square based method;local intensity estimation;Gaussian processes","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most widely used method involves a combination of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It offers quite high detection accuracy at the cost of high computational complexity. Therefore, it is impossible to use GPP-based (General Purpose Processor) embedded systems for this application. In this paper a hardware-software HOG+SVM pedestrian detection system implemented in a heterogeneous Xilinx Zynq device is presented. The base algorithm is supported with detection grouping and tracking procedures.

The investigations of thermoelectric properties, i.e.: electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient and the thermal conductivity, were carried out in the temperature range from RT to 910 K. On the basis of the experimental data, the temperature dependencies of the thermoelectric Figure of merit ZT were calculated. Detailed analysis of all obtained results was performed with additional insight into the role of the synthesis method on received thermoelectric properties. Superionic thermoelectric materials based on $Cu_{2}X$ (X = S, Se, Te) are intensively studied in recent years due to the very high values of their ZT parameter [1]. Unfortunately, their transport properties are unstable because of the high mobility of copper ions [2]. $Cu_{1.8}S$ is much more stable compared to $Cu_{2}S$ and used to be obtained mainly by the mechanical alloying method [3], [4].

Certain class refers to surface effects in the discharge sources, denoted as voids and following surface recombination processes. Discharges occur in localized spots creating so called effective discharge surface. Research was focused on assessment of the changes of surface properties of investigated dielectric material in long term test in flat gaseous inclusions with a diameter much bigger than thickness of the void. The presented experiments were performed on Nomex paper, designed for high voltage applications, including motor conductor coil wrap and transformer layer insulation. Partial discharges cause thermal effects and temperature rise around discharge clusters leading to dielectric material degradation and local variations of surface resistivity. The electrode setup created homogenous electric field distribution.

A voltage-fed series resonant inverter (SRI) is frequently used as a reliable and cost-effective converter, providing various power control strategies. This paper analyses the load current harmonics content in an SRI for induction heating controlled using particular cases of the Asymmetrical Voltage-Cancellation (AVC) control strategy, belonging to fixed-frequency control techniques. The analysis is carried out for the inverter operation at the minimum values of frequencies guaranteeing zero-voltage switching, and at the fixed frequencies assuring power control in an assumed range of power. Moreover, the impact of the quality factor of the load circuit has been taken into account.

However, configuring FRR mechanisms to tolerate multiple failures poses challenging algorithmic problems. While state-of-the-art solutions leveraging arc-disjoint arborescence-based network decompositions ensure that failover routes always reach their destinations eventually, even under multiple concurrent failures, these routes may be long and introduce unnecessary loads; moreover, they are tailored to worst-case failure scenarios. This paper presents an algorithmic framework for improving a given FRR network decomposition, using postprocessing. In particular, our framework is based on iterative arc swapping strategies and supports a number of use cases, from strengthening the resilience (e.g., in the presence of shared risk link groups) to improving the quality of the resulting routes (e.g., reducing route lengths and induced loads). Our simulations show that postprocessing is indeed beneficial in various scenarios, and can therefore enhance today's approaches.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2020.2998019","Vienna Science and Technology Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9102391","Resilience;fault-tolerance;computer networks;failover","Routing;Additives;Resilience;Load modeling;Communication networks;Focusing;Mission critical systems","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Nevertheless, existing developments of the feedback-based SA-TDC are characterized by much longer conversion time than that for feedforward SA-TDCs. In the paper, a concept of the feedback-based SA-TDC with dynamic equalization of logic propagation delays in the feedback loops is presented.

A grouping of pixels to one virtual pixel, that recovers composite signals and event driven strobes, to control comparisons of fractional signals between neighboring pixels are the actuators of the algorithm. The circuitry necessary to implement the algorithm requires an extensive inter-pixel connection grid of analog and digital signals, that are exchanged between pixels.

Especially in medical industry, screens became an essential part of the daily work of doctors and medical staff. From patient monitors to blood sugar test devices, displays are present in all shapes and functions. However, these screens are still limited to be used in devices which can't be sterilized. This is caused by the very harsh conditions of steam sterilizations, the most common type in Europe. Hereby, temperatures up to 135 degree Celsius and 3 bar pressure occur. This work is about the investigation of possible ways to insulate the displays to prevent them from permanent damages due to steam sterilizations and have a look on the possibility of cooling down the modules. For insulation an aerogel based insulation was tested with different LCD, LED and OLED displays. The aim of this research is enabling the use of displays in medical devices which need to be controlled manually and do not give back precise feedback.

Utilization of an additional temperature sensor enables to find out the information about dynamic change of cooling condition. The RT is used for approximating how fast TΔT system can react to the dynamic changes in surrounding environment. Using R-C thermal model in Spice environment, the Reaction Time is analyzed as a variable which is dependent on the convection coefficient and heat generated inside chip. Furthermore, RT values were evaluated versus the placement of additional temperature sensor on the body of a laptop. As results, better location of additional temperature sensor leads a rapid detection of change in surrounding condition in other words short Reaction Time. The advantage of this technique is that the changes of cooling condition can be quickly discovered. Consequently, the control system can react much faster in order to deliver the maximum processor's throughput while guarantee the thermal safety.","","978-83-63578-12-1","10.23919/MIXDES.2017.8005227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8005227","Temperature;power dissipation;cooling;integrated circuits;microprocessors;Reaction Time;Time Shift","Integrated circuits","convection;cooling;microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;power aware computing;SPICE;temperature sensors;thermal management (packaging)","high performance microprocessor throughput enhancement;reaction time;ambient cooling condition;temperature sensor;TΔT control system;R-C thermal model;Spice environment;convection coefficient;thermal safety","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method analyzing the transfer function (TF) of the transformer windings makes it possible to track changes in the electrical and mechanical parameters of the windings due to the occurrence of the various operating stresses (e.g. high current short-circuits). The paper presents analysis regarding the use of wideband, random signals (applied from a pseudo-white noise generator) for determining the transfer function of transformer windings.

Therefore it was difficult to establish in GUM directly TWSTFT station. Based on many years of close cooperation between National Institute of Telecommunications (NIT) and GUM the decision of placing TWSTFT station at NIT has been made, because NIT is located outside of strict city center and the antenna view is much better. The optical time transfer system (OTTS) to connect GUM and NIT is used. The length of the fiber optic line is about 28 km. Until now, the line was used for the purpose of continuous time comparison between the two organizations, so the entire fiber optic part of time transfer had to be redesigned to support two parallel transmissions.

A full suspension model of a SUV type wheeled vehicle was proposed by the authors. In order to formulate the control law of the vehicle suspension, it was necessary to include in the model all elements which have an influence on its dynamic properties. Vertical vibrations as well as pitch and roll was taken into account. In modelling of lateral swaying, torsion bars have been taken into account which are of great importance. For the construction of the active suspension of the wheeled vehicle, the authors used hydraulic cylinders controlled by proportional pressure valves. As a master controller, an optimal control with a quadratic quality indicator was used. Each of the strut suspensions has been equipped with a direct controller whose purpose was to reduce vertical vibrations. Longitudinal and lateral vibrations are reduced by the use of a master controller. Thanks to the use this type of control, it was possible to formulate a quality indicator which takes into account both driving comfort and good vehicle handling. The literature review shows that research of the active suspension control is generally carried out on models reduced to a quarter of a vehicle suspension. The original, 7DOF model of SUV suspension and dynamics equations describing the actuators - which enabled the synthesis of control for the real object - were used in this work.","","978-1-7281-0702-8","10.1109/CarpathianCC.2019.8766004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8766004","active vehicle suspension;optimal controller;hydraulic actuator","Suspensions (mechanical systems);Mathematical model;Automobiles;Vibrations;Actuators;Valves;Vehicle dynamics","automotive components;bars;control system synthesis;electrohydraulic control equipment;optimal control;quality control;road vehicles;suspensions (mechanical components);torsion;valves;vehicle dynamics;vibration control;wheels","wheeled vehicle active suspension;SUV type;control law;vertical vibrations;optimal control;quadratic quality indicator;strut suspensions;longitudinal vibrations;lateral vibrations;7DOF model;dynamics equations;vehicle handling;electrohydraulic actuators;torsion bars;hydraulic cylinders;pressure valves","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two POCS algorithms are proposed: iterative POCS and one-step POCS. While the one-step POCS is based on matrix inversion, the iterative projections can be implemented using a chain of standard circuit operations: a low-pass filter and a clipping circuit, respectively. The perfect signal recovery of the infinite projection iteration can be viewed as the completion of the nonperfect input reconstruction achieved in continuous-time digital signal processing from level crossings. The comparative analysis of simulation results for both iterative and one-step POCS algorithms show the importance of a good selection of the initial guess for the POCS reconstruction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2839186","Polish National Center of Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8361846","Level-crossing sampling;signal reconstruction;projection onto convex sets;event-based signal processing","Signal processing algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Signal reconstruction;Encoding;Standards;Simulation","bandlimited signals;filtering theory;image reconstruction;iterative methods;low-pass filters;signal processing;signal reconstruction;signal sampling","continuous-time digital signal processing;level crossings;POCS reconstruction;level-crossing samples;bandlimited signals;neighboring levels;perfect signal reconstruction;associated implicit information;POCS algorithms;iterative projections;perfect signal recovery;infinite projection iteration;nonperfect input reconstruction;one-step POCS algorithms;projection onto convex sets;clipping circuit;iterative POCS algorithms;low-pass filter","","1","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even though overvoltage protection systems, such as metal oxide surge arresters, are often employed, the overvoltages generated in power systems can still have a significant impact on the insulation systems of the windings of a power transformer. There are numerous examples of transformer failures as a result of overvoltages occurring during operation, even in cases that standard impulse voltage tests show no indication of potential problems and the transformers are protected by surge arresters. Comparisons of the internal overvoltages generated in transformers during voltage tests as well as those generated during standard operation of electrical networks provides fundamental insights into these overvoltages; insights which in turn can be used to improve the construction of insulation systems and overvoltage protection approaches and ultimately increase the reliability of transformers. In this paper, internal overvoltages occurring in the windings of selected transformer during standard voltage tests are compared with those which occur during typical operation of a transformer in an electrical power system. Overvoltages measured in the windings of the transformer form the basis of this comparison. Measurements were conducted with the transformer being subjected to voltage impulse tests, as well as transient voltages with waveforms simulating overvoltages generated in electrical power systems. In order to investigate the response of the windings to voltage strokes, full and chopped lightning voltage impulses were applied to the transformer. The waveforms of overvoltages generated in the electrical power systems were modelled as a rectangular voltage stroke, sinusoidal voltage, voltage with shape of “sweep sinus” also often referred to as a chirp signal and voltage with shape of “sweep ramp”.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2018.007001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8410726","transformers;insulation systems;voltage tests;internal overvoltages;overvoltage impact","Surges;Power transformer insulation;Surge protection;Lightning;Windings","arresters;impulse testing;lightning;lightning protection;overvoltage protection;power transformers;surge protection;transformer windings","electrical power system;transformer form;voltage impulse tests;chopped lightning voltage impulses;standard lightning impulses;operational overvoltages;operation transformers;overvoltage protection systems;power systems;insulation systems;power transformer;transformer failures;standard impulse voltage tests;internal overvoltages;standard operation;standard voltage tests;transformer winding responses","","1","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reduction of such overvoltages is achieved by effective earthing of the neutral. It is assumed that the system is effectively earthed if the relative temporary overvoltage values caused by earth faults do not exceed the established limit value of 1.4 pu. It is believed that the effectiveness of earthing will be assured when, for all system conditions, the ratio of the zero-sequence reactance to the positive-sequence reactance is positive and ≤3, and the ratio of zero-sequence resistance to positive-sequence reactance is positive and <;1. However, it appears that, despite the fulfilment of these conditions, a single line-to-earth short-circuit can cause overvoltage exceeding by far the value of 1.4 pu. Such a situation may occur for a disturbance in the form of a single-phase break and earth fault in a power system. This article presents models and results of simulation tests, which allowed for a comprehensive description of those disturbances both in idealised and real systems. Furthermore, the authors suggest solutions to mitigate those severe overvoltages.","1751-8695","","10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.1688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994036","","","earthing;fault location;overvoltage;overvoltage protection;power system faults;power transformers","zero-sequence reactance;positive-sequence reactance;zero-sequence resistance;line-to-earth short-circuit;single-phase break;earth fault;power system;idealised systems;real systems;severe overvoltages;temporary overvoltages;high-voltage power systems;single-phase earth faults;effective earthing;relative temporary overvoltage values;established limit value;system conditions","","","15","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of Weigh-in-Motion systems equipped with different numbers of axle load sensors. The paper presents the results of in situ tests and simulations. Experiments were carried out on 16-sensors system and were supplemented by results obtained by simulations using multibody dynamic software. For accuracy assessment of weighing systems, two criteria were used: the 95%-percent relative error and the reliability characteristic. Quantitative relationship between the number of axle load sensors and weighing accuracy was estimated.

The low-power design cannot impair the performance of readout electronics or limit the capabilities of the SiPM itself. This paper presents a two-channel integrated circuit (IC) designed in Austria Mikro Systeme CMOS 350-nm technology dedicated for the SiPM-based applications. The input stage is a super-common-gate architecture. Each channel of the IC consists of an amplifier and a peak detector with an offset reduction circuit. The power consumption of the single channel is less than 3 mW from the single voltage supply (3.3 V). Moreover, the number of channels of the IC can be easily increased thanks to small dimensions of the circuit. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the IC including: noise performance with adjustment of the input transistor's size, transient and dc simulations of the amplifier and the peak detector, and the introduction of a simple offset reduction technique for the peak detector.

As a consequence, their formal verification requires significant computational resources due to a large state space. Nevertheless, an analysis of the generated model is needed to assure its correctness and the ability to represent source data. As a solution to this problem, we present an approach for constraint-based generation of a complete workflow log for a given BPMN model. In this paper, we propose a method to extract directed sub graphs representing token flows in the process together with a set of predefined constraints. Likewise, in the case of process simulation, these constraints ensure the correctness of the generated traces. Ultimately, the obtained results can be compared to the original workflow log used for process discovery in order to verify the obtained model.","","978-83-949419-5-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511250","business process management;process verification;workflow logs;constraint programming","Unified modeling language;Process control;Business process management;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Analytical models","business data processing;constraint handling;data mining;formal verification;graph theory;workflow management software","discovery algorithms;computational resources;BPMN model;business process models;workflow log;directed sub graphs represention;formal verification;constraint programming;synthetic business process traces","","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to its propensity to metastasize and lack of effective therapies for most patients with advanced disease, early detection of melanoma is a clinical imperative. Thickness is one of the most important factor in melanoma prognosis and it is used to establish the size of the surgical margin, as well as to select patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy. However, little work has concentrated on the evaluation of melanoma thickness both from the clinical as well as computer-aided diagnostic side. To address this problem, we propose an effective computer-vision based machine learning tool that can perform the preoperative evaluation of melanoma thickness. The novelty of our approach is that we directly predict the thickness of the skin lesion into one of three classes: less than 0.75 mm, 0.76-1.5 mm, and greater that 1.5 mm. In this study, we use transfer learning of the pre-trained, adapted to our application VGG-19 convolutional neural network (CNN) with an adjusted densely-connected classifier. Due to the limited data we investigate the transfer learning method where we apply knowledge from model trained on a different task. Our database contains 244 dermoscopy images. Experiments confirm the developed algorithm's ability to classify skin lesion thickness with 87.2% overall accuracy what is a state-of-the-art result in melanoma thickness prediction.","2160-7516","978-1-7281-2506-0","10.1109/CVPRW.2019.00333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9025570","","Melanoma;Lesions;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks","biomedical optical imaging;convolutional neural nets;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;skin;tumours","transfer learning method;skin lesion thickness;melanoma thickness prediction;VGG-19 model transfer learning;malignant melanoma incidence rate;melanoma mortality;clinical imperative;melanoma prognosis;sentinel lymph node biopsy;computer-aided diagnostic side;effective computer-vision based machine;VGG-19 convolutional neural network;computer-vision based machine learning tool;dermoscopy images;size 0.76 mm to 1.5 mm","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quantitative approach offers greater information regarding the relationship between measured quantities on phase-resolved patterns and charge decay phenomena inside the void. The comparison of PD inception phase angles between continuous and chopped sequence was used as an indicator for calculation of internal charge time decay in the void. The precise calculation of time constant for various void wall materials was presented. The decaying charge resulted in the variation of the electric field from deposited and accumulated charges.

The proposed method estimates the positions and orientations of distributed sensor arrays, the synchronization timeline offsets as well as the positions of spatially distributed events emitted by an uncontrolled source or sources. The proposed two-step optimization consists in finding the maximum likelihood estimate of the relative geometry of a distributed system based on Directions of Arrival (DoAs) observed independently at each array. Next, the final positions of distributed arrays, the positions of acoustic events, and the synchronization offsets between the nodes are computed by solving a linear least square problem based on the observed Time Differences of Arrival (TDoAs) between the arrays and the relative positions estimated in the first optimization step. The evaluation results indicate that passive self-calibration of distributed sensor arrays can be conveniently achieved by observing acoustic events generated by an uncontrolled source based on the measured DoAs and TDoAs.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2889438","Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej; European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8586946","Microphone array processing;distributed sensor networks;geometry calibration;synchronization;maximum likelihood estimation;least squares approximation","Synchronization;Geometry;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Sensor arrays;Acoustics;Microphones","calibration;direction-of-arrival estimation;distributed sensors;least squares approximations;maximum likelihood estimation;microphone arrays;optimisation;position measurement;sensor arrays;synchronisation","distributed sensor arrays;synchronization timeline offsets;spatially distributed events;acoustic event generation;TDoA estimation;time differences of arrival estimation;linear least square problem;DoA estimation;directions of arrival estimation;geometry;maximum likelihood estimation;two-step optimization;array signal processing;distributed microphone arrays;passive joint localization;passive self-calibration","","2","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In an itinerant connection, one of the connection end nodes is allowed to change. Itinerant routing could also be considered a form of connection restoration, where a connection has to be restored to a different end node. With the introduction and growth of mobile-network services and content-oriented services, and the eventual deployment of elastic optical networks, there is a need to support this itinerant routing in the elastic optical networks. We present and discuss two major use cases of the itinerant routing, and propose a novel reconfiguration algorithm. Our algorithm does not deteriorate the network performance, and requires half as many new links to configure in comparison with the complete shortest-path reconfiguration algorithm.

The basic function of the legs is the visual separation of the backstage and off stage with a simultaneous possibility for the actors to move around. However, due to their large size and location within the main stage action, the surfaces of the legs have a significant impact on the sound propagation in the room. Most often they are made of textile materials stretched on the frame, which creates a sound-absorbing and reflective acoustic system. The degree of sound absorption and the shape of these surfaces will determine the energy of the sound reflected and transmitted to the audience. The properly selected number of legs and the type of fabric, also have a positive effect on obtaining comparable acoustic conditions in the audience and on stage. The article presents the analysis of the influence of the structure and shape of the stage curtain set layout on the distribution of the sound power parameter at the audience, and also the analysis of the interaction between the stage and orchestra through the example of selected interiors of some opera theaters. The research was carried out on computer models using geometric methods. The results indicate to what extent the type and shape of the legs can affect the transmission of sound from the stage to the audience.","","978-1-5386-7114-6","10.1109/ACOUSTICS.2018.8502409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502409","stage legs;sound strength;opera houses","Legged locomotion;Layout;Computational modeling;Reverberation;Absorption;Textiles","acoustic wave absorption;acoustic wave propagation;acoustic wave reflection;architectural acoustics;buildings (structures);noise abatement;noise measurement;structural engineering","visual separation;main stage action;sound propagation;sound-absorbing system;reflective acoustic system;sound absorption;audience;sound power parameter;stage curtain legs arrangement;sound distribution;opera houses;theatre stage;acoustic conditions","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explains reasons of a mismatch between a shape of VMS obtained from different SCS for IL sensor. A new approach is proposed to increase compatibility between VMS from impedance SCS and generator based SCS.

In order to figure out the efficiency of WEbRTC implementation in mobile network, the QoS parameters were used: throughput of media streams, error rate, delay and jitter. During experiments, 4K video streams were transmitted with the use of WebRTC technology via an IEEE 802.11ac network. The results of the experiments were compared with the ones obtained for non-responsive (not congestion controlled) UDP streams. WebRTC transmissions were live transmissions from a web camera, and UDP transmissions were emulated with the use of the iPerf tool. Results of the comparative analysis show that if the total throughput of simultaneously transmitted video streams exceeds the available throughput of the wireless link, the WebRTC is able to scale down the transmitted stream to preserve the real-time character of the stream and significantly reduce the error rate. As a result, the observed bit error rate achieved by the WebRTC was about three orders of magnitude lower than the bit error rate of non-responsive UDP streams. However, this improvement of the quality of service of the WebRTC media streams is at a cost of quality of experience (lower frame rate).","1847-358X","978-953-290-088-0","10.23919/SOFTCOM.2019.8903749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903749","DSCP;IEEE 802.11;Quality of Service;WebRTC;Wireless Multimedia Extensions","","DiffServ networks;Internet;jitter;quality of service;telecommunication congestion control;transport protocols;video communication;video streaming;wireless LAN","sender-driven WebRTC congestion control coexisting;QoS assurance applied;wireless LAN;multimedia communication;SIP-based;WebRTC architecture;QoS solutions;RSVP-based;DiffServ-based;WEbRTC implementation;mobile network;QoS parameters;jitter;4K video streams;WebRTC technology;IEEE 802.11ac network;nonresponsive UDP streams;not congestion controlled;WebRTC transmissions;live transmissions;UDP transmissions;comparative analysis show;simultaneously transmitted video streams;available throughput;wireless link;transmitted stream;observed bit error rate;WebRTC media streams;experience;lower frame rate","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, we present the Maximum Likelihood estimator derived under the assumption that the Direction of Arrival measurements follow the von Mises-Fisher distribution. Secondly, using unified notation, we show the relations between the cost functions of a number of state-of-the-art relative geometry estimators. Thirdly, we derive a novel estimator that exploits the concept of rays between the arrays and source event positions. Finally, we show the evaluation results for the presented estimators in various conditions, which indicate that major improvements in the probability of convergence to the optimum solution over the existing approaches can be achieved by using the proposed ray-based estimator.","2379-190X","978-1-5090-6631-5","10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9054752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054752","array processing;distributed sensor networks;geometry calibration;maximum likelihood;least squares","","","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually TF acquisition is realized by Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA) or Low Voltage Impulse (LVI) methods, which are textbf off-line type methods. However, in power systems other wideband signals – e.g. voltage transients – can also occur and there is a possibility of using them for identification of the TF characteristics. Voltage transients can arise in ”natural” way, (e.g. overvoltages) or alternatively can be artificially injected into transformer terminals.

This phenomenon is named magneto-phoresis, and is used in a various commercial and industrial processes for, among others, for separation of solid magnetic particles suspended in fluids. There are two methods for calculating forces acting on a magnetic particle placed in a magnetic liquid: the first is an equivalent dipole method and the second method is based on Maxwell's stress tensor. Both of these forces can be used in hyperthermia based on magnetic fluids supplied to the patient's body via blood.

The control also reduces the power losses in the transformer and power losses in the MV grid. The transformer winding arrangement was chosen because of the possibility of transforming the energy from a single-phase prosumers source to the loads connected to the other phases of the transformer's LV side.

The purpose of the paper is to present the problems related to the overvoltages of the power system caused by lightning. The article analyses two possible scenarios of sources of these disturbance: shielding failure and backflashover phenomena. The first case concerns the situation when, despite the ground wires used, it is possible to discharge into the phase conductor. The second case concerns the situation of loss of electrical strength of the insulation system used. The aim of the paper is to analyze the possibility of damage to station equipment as a result of lightning to the elements of the overhead line supplying the 110 kV/MV station. For this purpose, overvoltages levels in 110 kV substation will be determined for characteristic peak values of lightning currents: Imax and Imin - respectively for scenario of shielding failure and backflashover phenomena. Between the Imax and Imin values, we assume lightning protection (lightning strikes to ground wire). The calculations were carried out on a selected fragment of the real 110 kV power system.

The first of them is based on the reserve factor, defined in this paper. A solution is being sought after, for which the reserve factor, being an objective function, reaches it's maximum. In the second criterion the annual cost of the network has been analyzed. A sum of the cost of sectionalizing switches and the cost of undelivered energy is covered by the Distribution System Operator constitute the objective function. A minimum cost solution has been sought after. It's own evolutionary algorithm has been used for the sake of analyzing the complex combinatorial task of sectionalizing switch localization.

The latter is defined as a first technology from a given area implemented in an enterprise, that determines or strongly influences the choice of further technologies from the same area. Seed ICT selection is particularly relevant for enterprises whose core business activity relies on online service provision. In this paper we present a user-requirement-based interaction scheme of an application that models the evolution of enterprise ISs, taking into account the production patterns of software releases, the functionalities offered, the users' community growth trends, and other factors. The evolution is modeled by hybrid discrete-time/discrete-event systems, and multi-models built with them. The technology choice is supported by multicriteria ranking algorithms that apply IS innovativeness forecasts. Moreover, this evolution model of enterprise IS can handle different uncertainties and cyber security issues. We present the use cases and scenarios, model management, and the knowledge base that stores time series, IS characteristics and forecasts. The use of this application is illustrated by a real-life example of three popular open-source CMSs. We conclude that an informed choice of the first IS and the corresponding enterprise architecture as a seed technology is particularly relevant for start-ups and SMEs. An extended variant of the above application may also provide decision support to developer teams seeking software evolution models to discover and apply the best-possible technology development and market strategies.","2163-2871","978-1-7281-5411-4","10.1109/SOCA.2019.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8953037","Software evolution, Online services provision, Information systems, Interface design, Multimodels, Versioning","","business data processing;customer services;decision support systems;discrete event systems;information systems;information technology;public domain software;security of data;small-to-medium enterprises;time series;user interfaces","technology development;technology evolution model;enterprise information systems;seed ICT selection;business activity;online service provision;user-requirement-based interaction scheme;enterprise ISs;time series;enterprise architecture;software evolution models;discrete-event systems;hybrid discrete-time systems;multicriteria ranking algorithms;cyber security issues;knowledge base;open-source CMS","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Planning process incorporates performing measurements, detecting landmarks and visualizing relevant structures in 3D. To automatize this process, a segmentation is required. Due to the lack of methods enabling parallel aorta and left ventricle segmentation we propose a fully automatic neural network approach based on 2D U-Net architecture. Convolutional neural network architecture was trained on 44 studies (22 raw CTA datasets and 22 elastic deformed scans) and tested on another 18 stacks of data.

It constitute the key operation for digital filters as well as object classification, to name a few. Recently we faced implementation issues related to tensor decomposition into orthogonal factors, as well as tensor projections onto the orthogonal tensor bases. Also these rely heavily on the MAC operations. However, a serious problem of the numerical accuracy vs. operation speed of these operations can be observed when implemented with the floating point arithmetic realized in a hardware or a software platform. If not carefully approached, this can lead to significant numerical errors which are frequently overlooked by inexperienced engineers critically relying on standard libraries. In this paper we remind, dust off and discuss some computational aspects of the floating point implementation of the MAC operations in big data signal processing tasks on various platforms, and in different operation modes (serial, parallel, software, hardware). Such algorithms as simple summation, the Kahan algorithm, as well as some hybrid solutions are analyzed in respect to their accuracy, simplicity in implementation, and resource consumption, as well as speed of execution.","","978-1-7281-3345-4","10.1109/SA47457.2019.8938060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938060","Floating-point arithmetic;tensor decompositions;Kahan summation;inner product","Tensors;Software algorithms;Libraries;Software;Computational modeling;Sorting;Hardware","digital filters;floating point arithmetic;tensors","inner product computation;floating-point arithmetic;multiply-and-accumulate;digital signal processing;digital filters;object classification;orthogonal factors;tensor projections;orthogonal tensor bases;MAC operations;numerical accuracy;operation speed;software platform;floating point implementation;big data signal processing tasks","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, in this paper we focus on the application of Internet of Things (IoT) approach that would both improve education and streamline organization. From the variety of educational activities implemented in MEC, our area of focus is multi-party audiovisual collaboration during online classes. The scale and geographic scattering of participants makes this particular activity technically challenging and, at the same time, promising when considering application of IoT approach.

Since electricity demand varies as does the supply by RES, the remaining residual load must be covered by flexible technologies that are required to balance the different types of fluctuations. In this study, these flexibility options are divided into three categories: increasing the residual load, decreasing the residual load and shifting the electricity demand / supply temporally or spatially. Furthermore, typical technological options are discussed for each category, and four flexibility criteria are used to compare their technical and economic characteristics. These include the activation time, duration of flexibility provision, number of activations and activation costs. The study reveals that various options exist and no one technology dominates. However, within the flexibility categories, it can be shown that some appliances have advantages in three of the four categories compared to the other options. Ultimately, the choice of the most appropriate flexibility option depends on the requirements of the energy system. It can be concluded that a mix of technologies will be needed to cover the future flexible demand that may include short-term changes of the residual load as well as long-term downturns of RES generation.","2165-4093","978-1-5090-5499-2","10.1109/EEM.2017.7981983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7981983","energy markets;energy system analysis;flexibility options;modelling;sector coupling","Power generation;Economics;Production;Europe;Renewable energy sources;Fluctuations;Wind","power generation economics;renewable energy sources;supply and demand","technoeconomic characteristics;European energy system;renewable energy sources;RES generation;residual load;electricity demand-supply;activation costs","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the first solution has a well-established position in the WebRTC technology, the layered simulcast still remains in an early stage of development. The goal of this paper was to compare behavior of the two WebRTC simulcast schemes in terms of the key feature of the simulcast, i.e. its adaptability to network conditions. To achieve this goal, we wrote the WebRTC application (a simple videomonitoring software) that act as simulcast sender. The adaptability of the simulcast schemes was investigated for the case of video traffic transmitted in a heterogeneous test network (wired and wireless). As adaptability indicators, such as the throughput and packet error rate were used. Results of the simulcasting of 4K video show that in the case of infrastructural limitations only there are no significant differences between the adaptability of the stream replication simulcast and the layered simulcast. Adaptability for dynamic limitations (introduced by background traffic) was better in the case of the layered simulcast.","1847-358X","978-953-290-088-0","10.23919/SOFTCOM.2019.8903887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903887","layered coding;QoS;simulcast;stream replication;WebRTC","","Internet;video streaming","WebRTC technology;WebRTC simulcast schemes;stream replication simulcast;layered stream replication","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the fact that the energy system and transport are based on fossil fuels, there is a huge potential for its efficient use. Despite the fact that the technology of Peltier semiconductor modules has been known for many years, there are no solutions that might be commonly disseminated. There is also a deficit of available sources that in a transparent, coherent and synthetic way could provide guidelines for the constructors of such devices, and show how much energy they can generate and what efficiency they have. Moreover, the Peltier modules available on the market are burdened with many stereotypes. When trying to use this technology, it should be remembered that in addition to the Peltier phenomenon, the module's operation is based on four other physical phenomena: two of them have a negative impact and they determine the practically obtained parameters of the Peltier module. These are: Joule effect and heat conduction phenomenon. The other two phenomena: Seebeck and Thomson ones, play slightly smaller roles. The aim of the authors was to investigate the self-made model of a thermoelectric generator TEG, constructed using Peltier modules. The paper presents the results of measurements and the method of determining the electrical efficiency of this model. Additionally, a temperature range was determined at that such recovery has a measurable utilitarian aspect and economic sense. The limitations of semiconductor technology of Peltier cells have been given, and design guidelines at construction process of such systems to optimize their efficiency are presented.","","978-1-5386-8255-5","10.1109/EPMCCS.2018.8596493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8596493","Peltier module;Seebeck effect;thermoelectric generator TEG;determination of efficiency","Temperature measurement;Generators;Cooling;Heating systems;Power generation;Temperature distribution;Aluminum","heat conduction;heat recovery;Peltier effect;Seebeck effect;thermoelectric conversion;waste heat","Peltier semiconductor modules;Peltier phenomenon;heat conduction phenomenon;electrical efficiency;semiconductor technology;Peltier cells;waste heat recovery system;high efficiency technology;waste heat energy utilization;energy market;energy system;transport;stereotypes;Joule effect;Seebeck phenomena;Thomson phenomena;thermoelectric generator;TEG;fossil fuels","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Maintaining a stable posture is connected above all with the motor control provided by the human nervous system. Equally important is also the unequivocal determination of spatial orientation and consideration of the impact of forces from different sources on the body. The appearance of unpredictable external stimuli that may destabilize the standing position requires an immediate response from the posture stability control system. Analyzing the cases of the first two strategies for maintaining the balance, it can be noticed that both of them, due to their physical nature, resemble inverted pendulum systems and, given some simplifying assumptions, can be modeled as such.

The experiments were performed in a 1500-km loop arranged in the PIONIER production network, with T&F signals regarded as so-called “alien wavelength” network service. In the newest DWDM version, we observed very good stability of delivered signals: modified Allan deviation approach 10-16 for averaging longer than 104 s (for 10-MHz frequency signal), and time deviation below 15 ps for averaging up to 105 s for 1 PPS time signal. These results show that the DWDM alien wavelength service can be used for high-demanding applications like cesium fountains comparisons. Results achieved for the former version of DWDM were about one magnitude worse for a long-term comparison, but it can still be useful for less demanding applications. We found that the main reason for relatively poor results observed in the older generation of DWDM is the impact of the DCFs used in this DWDM approach.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2827178","OFTEN 15SIB05 Project; EMPIR programme co-financed by the Participating States and by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8340172","Alien wavelength;dense wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) network;optical fiber;time and frequency (T&F) transfer","Optical fiber networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;Optical fibers;Optical fiber cables;Optical fiber devices;Optical fiber dispersion;Fluctuations","optical fibre dispersion;optical fibre networks;wavelength division multiplexing","frequency signal;time deviation;DWDM alien wavelength service;DWDM approach;frequency distribution;different DWDM systems;dense wavelength-division-multiplexing networks;dispersion compensation fiber modules;in-line chromatic dispersion compensation;coherent signals;PIONIER production network;Allan deviation approach;alien wavelength network service;PPS time signal;long haul time distribution;cesium fountains;frequency 10 MHz;distance 1500 km","","5","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Software development companies frequently use a popular agile approach, and the most popular agile methodology is Scrum. A sprint retrospective is a Scrum process which is supposed to enable self-development and improve communication among team members. Unfortunately, the reality is usually different. The aim of the paper is to identify problems with retrospectives and to use enterprise architecture models to help different stakeholders to understand the problems of agile approach and to find reasons why sometimes it does not meet its goals. Next, the authors try to find solutions for the identified problems on the basis of a persona concept.","","978-83-946253-7-5","10.15439/2017F96","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8104709","Scrum;agile;retrospective;team work;enterprise architecture;ArchiMate","Computer architecture;Companies;Software;Stakeholders;Project management;Product development","business data processing;software architecture;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;team working","team members;enterprise architecture models;enterprise architecture approach;sprint retrospective example;holistic approach;software development companies;SCRUM process","","1","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main complication of this Networked Control System (NCS) control architecture is the presence of variable time delays. One solution is to reduce the temporal dependency of the individual parts of this model by introducing a buffer at the actuator. As long as variable delay is shorter than buffer length, the loop delay is constant and is equal to the buffer length. This makes design of the controller and stability analysis much easier. This paper proposes a novel co-design method taking into account sampling period, network parameters and optimal buffer length. A case study for a liquid level stabilisation problem is given.

On the other hand, there are technical obstacles related to the constructing lines between new power sources (e.g. wind farms) and power systems. Wind farms are frequently localised in areas where the power network is poorly developed. These difficulties necessitate specific ways in which wind farms can be connected with the existing power systems. One of them lies in locating new lines within the existing line right of way. Owing to the electromagnetic impact between the lines such solutions are not frequent. Too long close-proximity sections are avoided to reduce the consequences this impact. This study is devoted to the influence of high-voltage transmission lines on other power lines. The localisation options in a 400 kV line right of way are analysed.

The key technical challenges are related to the availability of data. While the first exascale machines are likely to be built within a single site, the input data is in many cases impossible to store within a single site. Alongside handling of extreme-large amount of data, the exascale system has to process data from different sources, support accelerated computing, handle high volume of requests per day, minimize the size of data flows, and be extensible in terms of continuously increasing data as well as increase in parallel requests being sent. These technical challenges are addressed by the general reference exascale architecture. It is divided into three main blocks: virtualization layer, distributed virtual file system, and manager of computing resources. Its main property is modularity which is achieved by containerization at two levels: 1) application containers - containerization of scientific workflows, 2) micro-infrastructure - containerization of extreme-large data service-oriented infrastructure. The paper also presents an instantiation of the reference architecture - the architecture of the PROCESS project (PROviding Computing solutions for ExaScale ChallengeS) and discuss its relation to the reference exascale architecture.

The analyzed projects were developed over more than 30 years, much larger than typical lifetime of computer industry software. Some general observations are drawn together with quantitative evaluation on how the quality of software, measured mainly by precision of the simulation, grows together with the complexity of software and tests. We find these observations interesting, even if attempts of generalization may remain to a degree speculative, as every researcher is tuning that to the particular needs of the own application.

It is also one of its evaluation criteria. It presents to investors the effectiveness of using their capital. Increasing profitability may be treated as a symptom of shareholder wealth, while its reduction may be a signal indicating a deterioration of the financial situation of the company. An investment in a company will be attractive to investors if the results obtained by it will enable the benefit from the dividend to be paid and if the share prices will show an upward trend. Therefore, profit and profitability are categories dependent on the company and affect the wealth of its owners. The ROE ratio is synthetic and is linked to, among others with the size of sales, asset use activity, and the size of the company's debt. However, the decisions regarding the capital structure of a company should be made not only by purely economic and financial analyses but also should take into account the social and environmental effects of economic activities. To take into account not only short-term financial goals but also long-term sustainable development goals during the decision-making process, we need intelligent and creative multi-criteria decision support tools. Bio-inspired artificial intelligence techniques-such as evolutionary algorithms, deep neural networks, or swarm algorithms, to give only a few examples-are gaining more and more popularity in the recent years. Evolutionary algorithms are optimization techniques that are modeled on the processes of evolution that are taking place in natural populations. They can find approximate solutions to the NP-hard global, multi-modal, and multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach-an agent-based bio-inspired system supporting decisions in the area of corporate finance, which takes into account not only financial goals but also the sustainable development goals. The system will allow for multi-objective optimization with the use of bio-inspired algorithms. In this paper, we will concentrate on one module of the proposed system-the evolutionary algorithm optimizing the ROE factor. During the experiments, we will verify the ability of the proposed algorithm to provide decision makers with reasonable, useful, and, at the same time, also innovative and non-obvious solutions concerning the desired capital structure of a given company, which usually operates in a rapidly changing environment. The proposed system will allow for taking into account more than one criteria and perform multi-objective optimization with the use of an evolutionary algorithm or an agent-based co-evolutionary algorithm, soit will be possible to include also the long-term goals of sustainable development in the future.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870201","AGH University of Science and Technology Statutory Project; Faculty of Management, Cracow University of Economics subsidies granted for maintaining the research capacity; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466578","Agent-based bio-inspired algorithms;bio-inspired artificial intelligence algorithms;corporate finance;decision support systems;DuPont analysis;evolutionary algorithms;Return on Equity;sustainable development","Companies;Economics;Sustainable development;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Stakeholders;Investment","artificial intelligence;computational complexity;decision making;decision support systems;evolutionary computation;financial data processing;financial management;investment;multi-agent systems;neural nets;optimisation;organisational aspects;profitability;share prices;sustainable development","financial analyses;social effects;environmental effects;economic activities;short-term financial goals;decision-making process;bio-inspired artificial intelligence techniques;swarm algorithms;optimization techniques;multiobjective optimization problems;ROE factor;agent-based co-evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary optimization;economic analyses;return on equity factor;agent-based bio-inspired system;corporate finance decisions;decision support system;sustainable development;NP-hard global","","","103","CCBY","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The other problem are harsh underwater conditions, such as water turbidity, noise, color vanishing, to name a few. In this paper we experiment with the deep learning approach, based on various convolutional neural networks, applied to the underwater object detection. Based on our underwater test sequences we conducted experiments aimed at measuring networks responses when trained on large databases of everyday objects when applied to underwater environment.

Knowledge about the tumor lodge position and shape could improve the radiation dose distribution. However, the tumor no longer exists after the surgery, but information about its position is available in the 3D image acquired before the surgery. Therefore, image registration algorithms can be used to estimate the tumor lodge localization and potentially improve the radiotherapy planning. In this work, we evaluate different variants of a Demons image registration algorithm. The nonparametric Demons algorithms are compared to a parametric registration procedure, the B-Splines free-form deformations. The results are evaluated using a target registration error and a medical expert visual inspection. The results show that for small deformations, the diffeomorphic, symmetric Demons are the most reliable, but for larger deformations, parametric B-Splines free-form deformations provide better results.

Fryze causes increase of total harmonic distortion (THD) and increase of source active powers resulting from higher harmonics of voltage and current. The authors of the present paper have proposed a method of the reduction of THD and rms value of the source current on the basis of the components of instantaneous power of the source. It has been demonstrated that the even component of that power secures a supply of the given active power from the source to the load. The odd component may be excluded from the instantaneous power of the source. Components of instantaneous power are the sums of the products of the even and odd components of source voltage and current. On the basis of these sums the voltage and current components have been determined, the compensation of which enables excluding the odd component of source instantaneous power, and in the same way- reduction of THD and rms value of the source current. The authors of the paper have presented the way of making use of the method in the situation when supply voltage is only odd or even function. It has been found out that it is possible to reduce THD of the source current several times in relation to THD of the source current while minimizing the source rms current according to Fryze, with negligible increase in the effective value of the source current in relation to the minimum value. Decrease of THD also causes significant decrease of active power of the source caused by higher harmonics of voltage and current.","","978-1-7281-1038-7","10.1109/WZEE48932.2019.8979702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979702","nonsinusoidal waveforms;effective value;total harmonic distortion;even and odd source power components","","harmonic distortion;power inductors;power system harmonics;resistors","THD;total harmonic distortion;linear resistor-inductor circuits;source active powers;source rms current;nonsinusoidal waveforms;voltage harmonics;current harmonics","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the number of variables increasing, the complexity of detection task grows quickly. The algorithm, Binary Classifier for Fault Detection (BaFFle), is devised to employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables and to detect the occurrences of fault over each distinct component using corresponding operation model. In this way, BaFFle converts a multivariate detection task into several univariate problems. Since the observations of a steady-state system are supposed to subject to certain probability distribution, the normal operation model is represented by probability distribution. In the original BaFFle algorithm, measured data is assumed Gaussian distributed. In order to get rid of the strong assumption in BaFFle, an improved BaFFle is proposed in this paper to estimate the distribution model by Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). A main advance of KDE is attributed to the non-parametric way of estimating probability distribution, resulting in a data-driven estimator. Experiments using real data from a multiphase flow rig proved the validation of KDE-based BaFFle. From the practice perspective, BaFFle has the potential of being applied to operation systems with non-Gaussian distributions.","","978-1-5386-4325-9","10.1109/MMAR.2018.8485862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485862","binary classifier for fault detection (BaFFle);kernel density estimation (KDE);principal component analysis (PCA);process condition monitoring","Estimation;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Fault detection;Probability distribution;Gaussian distribution;Monitoring","condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;Gaussian distribution;mechanical engineering computing;pattern classification;principal component analysis","KDE-based BaFFle;operation systems;nonGaussian distributions;Binary Classifier;Fault Detection;PCA;Fault detection;process condition monitoring;operation expectancy;Principal Component Analysis;corresponding operation model;multivariate detection task;probability distribution;normal operation model;original BaFFle algorithm;distribution model","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its main advantages are: flexibility (it supports software-defined wireless networking), scalability (it uses a three-tier optimization framework), and extendibility (it exploits a unified control interface with support for heterogeneous devices). Furthermore, CADWAN is complementary to ongoing developments in IEEE 802.11, especially 802.11ax.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2017.1601097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8255762","","Wireless fidelity;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Wireless communication;Optimization;Centralized control;Communication system security","radio access networks;telecommunication control;wireless LAN","CADWAN;control architecture;dense WiFi access networks;ubiquitous computing;wireless access networks;network-wide centralized control;wireless networking;dense WiFi Access networks","","7","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

An emerging variant of traditional relaying and forwarding schemes is the lossy forwarding and joint decoding (LF-JD) concept. In theory, LF-JD has shown the potential to improve spectral efficiency, reduce transmit power, and decrease outage probability by exploiting route diversity and the broadcast nature of radio transmissions. To be applied in real devices, a lower-layer protocol stack embracing the LF-JD concept needs to be designed. In this article, we show how LF-JD impacts the design of MAC and routing protocols and whether its benefits translate to performance improvements. We show that, in comparison to currently available solutions, LF-JD can provide gains in scenarios with high interference or poor signal strength such as in V2V networks.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2018.1800061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558503","","Relays;Decoding;Reliability;Media Access Protocol;Error probability;Routing protocols;Cooperative communication","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cooperative communication;decoding;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;wireless channels","MAC protocols;lossy forwarding impact;cooperative communication;relaying schemes;V2V networks;outage probability;lossy forwarding and joint decoding concept;transmit power reduction;traditional relaying;communication reliability;radio channels;spatial diversity;opportunistic relays;multihop ad hoc networks;wireless ad hoc networks;routing design;routing protocols;LF-JD concept;lower-layer protocol stack;radio transmissions;route diversity;forwarding schemes","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is well known that the problem can be mitigated by using an on-chip data compressor. The suitable data compressor should offer high compression and low signal distortions. In addition it should feature very low power consumption, low memory footprint and low latency. In this paper we evaluate the feasibility of exploiting spatial correlation between neural signals being recorded with closely spaced electrode array for compression purpose. We show that optimal signal decorrelation and compression is possible by linear signal transformation with the matrix obtained with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal PCA based matrix has a similar structure to the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) matrix, which is widely used in image compression. Finally, the performance of data compressor exploiting the PCA and the DCT is compared.

The stochastic nature of phenomena detected by the ASIC results in a very different amount of data after each collision of particles. The SALT generates a data packet which size may vary between one and 100 bytes in each clock cycle and which should be stored in a memory buffer regardless of its size. The memory buffer is based on a number of macro blocks. The input size of the macro block is a free parameter of the design so the optimization was performed taking into account occupied area and consumed power.

We will present the construction of directed graph of bigrams, data filtration model and we will perform validation on three real (not artificially created)datasets, each containing 1 000 000 microblogging posts from Twitter platform. We will compare our findings with our earlier researches that used hashtag - based analysis and simple NLP method namely lemmatization. Those methods were evaluated on the same dataset as we use in this paper. With bigrams network it is possible to obtain some limited information about subjects the users are talking about however less than when the analysis uses hashtags. Bigrams also work better than simple lemmatization that in our previous experiment did not produce any useful data. The approach that supplies us with most useful data describing content of microblogging posts seems to be hashtag filtration. However this last type of analysis requires the presence of additional annotation data in user messages. Terms generated by bigrams and hashtag analysis might not be identical and sometimes one of them might be valuable complement of the other. Bigrams network might show the general idea of the content of the information gathered in microblogging posts. It is recommended to visualize a filtered part of this graph (for example limited by weights of edges)to see the general idea of data consisted in this network.","","978-1-5386-7604-2","10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2018.8633108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8633108","Bigrams analysis;Social network;Microblog-ging;Subjects of discussion;Data filtration","Twitter;Tagging;Natural language processing;Image edge detection;Data models;Informatics","data analysis;directed graphs;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;social networking (online);Web sites","Twitter platform;bigrams network;hashtag analysis;bigram graph-based analysis;social media;directed graph;data filtration model;microblogging posts;NLP method;lemmatization;social network messages;bigrams analysis learning;annotation data","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is especially ubiquitous in the medical domain, in which some of the classes used during classification can be naturally under-represented. At the same time it can significantly affect the classification performance of most standard algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks. One of the approaches for dealing with data imbalance is artificially reducing the number of objects from the over-represented class, an approach called undersampling. In this paper we present a novel undersampling technique, Radial-Based Undersampling (RBU), and apply it to the classification of breast cancer histopathological images. The results of the conducted experimental analysis not only indicate the usefulness of the RBU algorithm in that task, but also shed light on some of the drawbacks of that method, which could potentially be used in the future to improve upon the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-7281-4852-6","10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8966010","","","cancer;convolutional neural nets;image classification;image sampling;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;support vector machines","convolutional neural networks;RBU algorithm;medical domain;data imbalance;breast cancer histopathological images","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the vast majority of attention in this field is given to binary problems, while their much more difficult multiclass counterparts are relatively unexplored. Handling data sets with multiple skewed classes poses various challenges and calls for a better understanding of the relationship among classes. In this paper, we propose multiclass radial-based oversampling (MC-RBO), a novel data-sampling algorithm dedicated to multiclass problems. The main novelty of our method lies in using potential functions for generating artificial instances. We take into account information coming from all of the classes, contrary to existing multiclass oversampling approaches that use only minority class characteristics. The process of artificial instance generation is guided by exploring areas where the value of the mutual class distribution is very small. This way, we ensure a smart oversampling procedure that can cope with difficult data distributions and alleviate the shortcomings of existing methods. The usefulness of the MC-RBO algorithm is evaluated on the basis of extensive experimental study and backed-up with a thorough statistical analysis. Obtained results show that by taking into account information coming from all of the classes and conducting a smart oversampling, we can significantly improve the process of learning from multiclass imbalanced data.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2913673","Polish National Science Center; Infrastruktura PL-Grid; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743475","Imbalanced data;machine learning;multiclass imbalance;oversampling.","Training;Learning systems;Taxonomy;Machine learning;Task analysis;Clustering algorithms;Proposals","","","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Controlling motors torque instead of speed makes new principle of how the drive works. Proposed method of control is based on controlling the motor torque in such a way that allows the user to set a desired torque value keeping the force on bike pedals constant. This article covers different methods of controlling the BLDC motor, analysis of electrical bike movement, methods of calculating the load torque, controlling electromagnetic torque of the motor, simulations and laboratory research.","","978-1-5386-5210-7","10.1109/ISEM.2018.8442987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8442987","brushless direct current motor;electric bike;motor torque control;kinematics","Torque;Bicycles;Brushless DC motors;Transistors;Permanent magnet motors","angular velocity control;brushless DC motors;electric motors;electric vehicles;machine control;torque control","electric bicycle;electrical bike drive;electrical motor;bike pedals;electrical bike movement;load torque;electromagnetic torque;motor speed;motor torque control","","1","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our evaluation, we show that RouteNet is able to predict accurately the delay distribution (mean delay and jitter) and loss even in topologies, routing and traffic unseen in the training (worst case MRE=15.4%).

In contrary to typical motion capture pattern recognition problem in this case we use only single inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. Head motions that we want to recognize in VR systems might be both natural head motions like nodding or shaking head (they might be used while interacting with VR avatars) and also elements of head-based navigation system or interface. The second type of actions is more challenging because it might contains actions that generate motion trajectories that do not appear in real-life, though they have to be possible to execute only by using a head. In this paper we propose a trajectory-based motion features description that is utilized by dynamic time warping (DTW) classificator. The training of the classificator requires using modified dynamic time warping barycenter averaging (DBA) heuristic algorithm which utilizes quaternions to represents rotations. The proposed pattern recognition system together with its evaluation on the set of head motions acquired by VR system is our original contribution. We have evaluated our method on dataset consisted of 8 types of motions performed by two persons (there are 160 motions samples). In leave-one-out evaluation we have obtained very good results: only 10% of one and 15% of another action has been incorrectly classified, while remaining 6 actions classes had been 100% correctly classified. Both dataset and implementation of proposed method can be downloaded, due to this our experiment can be reproduced.","","978-1-7281-5258-5","10.1109/ICFSP48124.2019.8938052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938052","Head motion analysis;signal processing;virtual reality glasses;dynamic time warping;quaternions","","accelerometers;avatars;human computer interaction;image classification;image motion analysis;motion estimation","trajectory-based motion features description;dynamic time warping classificator;pattern recognition system;VR system;head motion classification;single-accelerometer virtual reality hardware;head motions classification;virtual reality systems;single inertial measurement unit sensor;VR avatars;head-based navigation system;motion capture pattern recognition;DTW classificator;dynamic time warping barycenter averaging","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the driver needs to divide attention between the display and the real world. This issue can be addressed by employing Augmented Reality (AR). In this paper we propose a system in which important information for the driver are displayed on semi-transparent glasses included in an AR-headset and therefore are mixed with the real-world view.

This paper presents a new method of watermarking using lead-to-lead difference of values in the baseline of the host electrocardiogram. The method starts with delineation of the baseline and uses Kirchoff voltage law or interpolation to predict any selected lead from the remaining ones.

Forecasting efficiency relies on applied prediction formula and quality of data received from technical devices and manually inputted. They are often of low quality, with inconsistencies. However, high data quality is crucial for efficient forecasting/prediction purposes (also event detection from time series and pattern recognition), in particular during large data sets processing (often heterogeneous, including data obtained from IoT devices). Such processing should cover inconsistency analysis, interpolation of missing/lacking data, as well as the use of data pre-transformations. The paper presents problems of inconsistent, nonstationary data prediction on the example of stock level daily forecasting. Selected methods of time series interpolation are outlined. Results of implementation of algorithms for short-term time series prediction are illustrated and discussed. Prediction quality measured based on errors values calculated both in total and in a moving window is discussed. A concept of an adaptive algorithm based on a change in the prognostic formula depending on short-term characteristics of time series is outlined.","","978-953-233-095-3","10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8400228","time series analysis;prediction;forecasting;interpolation;adaptive prediction algorithms;Big Data;IoT","Time series analysis;Interpolation;Predictive models;Forecasting;Prediction algorithms;Extrapolation;Adaptation models","data analysis;forecasting theory;interpolation;time series","inconsistent large time series data;inconsistent data prediction;stock level daily forecasting;adaptive prediction;short-term time series prediction;time series interpolation;nonstationary data prediction;data sets processing","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics (LTCC) based packages allows the assembly of buried heaters in the near vicinity of the sensing layer. The heater must meet various requirements. Its resistance value should be in a reasonable range in order to allow the use of common power supply and the tolerances should be narrow to guarantee a stable working point without the need of additional control circuits. LTCC technology provides two ways for manufacturing of heaters: screen printing of thick film resistors or conducting lines formed as meander. For the first approach, a variety of pastes is available, but thick film resistors entail tolerances of 20% or more due to printing result and firing. Conducting lines are more stable with regard to tolerances, but their low sheet resistance results in low heater resistance if the area is limited. The use of resinate pastes as a potential solution of this problem is investigated in this work. These pastes have high organic portion and the resulting layers achieve a thickness in the range of few hundred nanometers after firing. As consequence, the sheet resistance of the conductor paths is increased and reasonable heater resistance values are achievable at small areas. The used of this pastes as an alternative approach for heater integration in LTCC packages will be discussed.","","978-0-9568086-4-6","10.23919/EMPC.2017.8346841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8346841","gas sensors;LTCC package;metal oxide;heater elemnts;resinate paste","Heating systems;Temperature sensors;Resistance;Gas detectors;Substrates;Temperature measurement","assembling;ceramic packaging;gas sensors;heat measurement;intelligent sensors;printing;temperature measurement;temperature sensors;thick film resistors;thick film sensors","printed heater elements;smart sensor packages;gas sensor technology;screen printing;conducting lines;low heater resistance;heater integration;thermal coupling;low sheet resistance;LTCC packaging;low temperature cofired ceramics based packaging;assembly;thick film resistor","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Kloss' formula is obtained. The main aim of the article is determination of a mathematical description of the torque vs. speed curve of induction motor and its application for vehicle motion modeling. Additionally, the moment of inertia of the motor rotor and the electric vehicle mass are considered in one equation as electromechanical system.

When speech signal is recorded in a reverberant environment, the microphones capture speech corrupted by room reverberation. Increasing the distance between the speaker and recording microphones, the power ratio of the direct and late room reverberation signals is decreased, which in turn decreases the accuracy of automatic speech recognition. This paper presents a multichannel Wiener filter which exploits geometric information about early room reflection paths in order to reduce late reverberation at the filter output. As a result of such pre-processing, the accuracy of automatic speech recognition systems is improved. The presented word error rate (WER) results for simulated rooms with different reverberation times indicate that the proposed rake multichannel Wiener filtering provides an improvement in accuracy of automatic speech recognition from distance in reverberant environments.

The combustion chamber heats a water jacket, which in turn transfers heat to the external circulation. The model is nonlinear because of the straw combustion process. Apart from this process, the other components of the model are linear and describe mass and heat transfer. The boiler model has single input and single output (SISO). The input of the model is the air mass flow and the output is the temperature of the combustion chamber. Based on the presented model, one proposed a closed-loop system to control the temperature of the combustion chamber. The closed-loop system consists of the classical PID controller, model of the whole plant and some inverse transfer function of the nonlinear part of the whole model.

The criterion of correct operation is the level of radiated emission; the value of which depends on the spatial orientation of the cooperating inductors. The sources of the generated harmonic disturbances, which are the nonlinearities of the output stage of the transmitter and the input circuits of the receiver, have been identified. On this basis, a peripheral model was created that allows prediction of the level of disturbances in a given position. The emission measurement in the ALSE chamber in a low frequency band of up to 1.7MHz was used as the verification method. The correctness of the proposed method was confirmed by the evaluation of the interface of the immobilizer commonly used in automotive vehicles.","","978-83-63578-16-9","10.23919/MIXDES.2019.8787133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787133","automotive;immobilizer;key fob;LF","Integrated circuits;Generators;Inductance;Couplings;Impedance","automotive components;coupled circuits;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic interference","operating range;automotive key fobs;radiated emissions test;low frequency band;mutual positions;magnetically coupled circuits;contactless communication interface;radiated emission;spatial orientation;cooperating inductors;generated harmonic disturbances;input circuits;peripheral model;given position;emission measurement;verification method;automotive vehicles","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper a direct non-uniform to time-scale (NUTS) transform is presented and applied to the ECG signal. Well accepted limits of bandwidth in particular sections of the ECG and established standards for the assessment of diagnostic quality help in evaluation of the influence the transform has to the diagnostic result. The transform uses a regular-grid Coiflet 5-th order nearly symmetric wavelet, but the novelty is a pointwise calculating of its correlation accordingly to non-uniform distribution of the electrocardio-gram samples. In tests with CSE Database files the proposed transform method yields not bit-accurate ECG signals, but the diagnostic results are more influenced by the non-uniform representation (for QRS mean deviation: +0.7 ms vs. original files) than by the transform itself (for QRS additionally: +0.6 ms) and all the results remain within the accuracy tolerance of the CEN industrial standard.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8857898","","Electrocardiography;Wavelet transforms;Correlation;Time series analysis;Databases;Wavelet analysis","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;signal sampling;wavelet transforms","direct transform;discrete nonuniform ECG;time-scale representation;adaptive sampling;nonuniform representations;ECG signal;diagnostic quality;regular-grid Coiflet 5-th order nearly symmetric wavelet;bit-accurate ECG signals;nonuniform representation;biosignal acquisition;QRS mean deviation;CEN industrial standard;electrocardiogram samples;CSE Database files","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the use of containers for network functions virtualization purposes entails a number of limitations, such as security and isolation problems resulting from the use of a shared kernel. This article introduces unikernel network functions as the next step toward network functions softwarization. The use of unikernels enables the implementation of network functions in the form of lightweight images that can run either on a hypervisor or directly on the hardware layer. It is shown that unikernel network functions achieve comparable performance results to those based on containers, while providing a significantly higher security level.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.1900138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930819","","Network function virtualization;Containers;Telecommunication services;Network security;Kernel","operating system kernels;security of data;software defined networking;software libraries;virtual machines;virtualisation","network functions softwarization;unikernel network functions;modern telecommunications infrastructure;telecommunication service providers;container technologies;hardware layer;security level","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Therefore, in this paper a wavelet-based data compressor suitable for multichannel implanted neural recording systems is proposed. The performance of the proposed compressor operating with two different wavelete transformations is analyzed. Next, based on distributed arithmetic approach, an energy-efficient architecture for DWT processor, a central part of the compressor, is proposed. The resulting DWT processor is implemented in 180 nm AMS CMOS process. The power consumption for 32 channel four-level DWT processor amounts to about 37 μW for orthogonal DWT (symlet4) and 32 μW for biorthogonal DWT (bior3.3).","","978-83-63578-12-1","10.23919/MIXDES.2017.8005282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8005282","Biomedical signal processing;data compression;implantable neural recording microsystems;discrete wavelet transform","Integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits;microprocessor chips;neural nets;radio networks;video recording;wavelet transforms","distributed arithmetic;DWT processor;wireless data transmission;multichannel neural recording system;on-chip data compressor;compressing neural data;multichannel implanted neural recording systems;wavelet transformations;distributed arithmetic approach;AMS CMOS process","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A comparison between a manual outline of an expert and segmentation results, widely used in most cases, appears to be insufficient. Taking into account the lack of reproducibility of the outlines made by experts, it is necessary to thoroughly analyze both inter- and intra-observer variability. To meet these requirements, the article proposes a new evaluation method for inter- and intra-observer variability of boundary delineation. The algorithm is based on three-dimensional signed Euclidean Distance Transformation. It allows to provide local information (for each point of the outline) about manual outlines deviation. The algorithm manages anisotropic image data such as magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) images. It can also be used for complex, non-convex structures. In addition, a method of selection the most reliable outline is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed by examining the boundary deviation of anatomical structures in CT data.

Feature extraction in condition monitoring requires domain knowledge about a system and its possible fault cases. To find the most sensitive features for fault patterns, one has to evaluate the relevancy of features. In this paper the authors use ReliefF, which is a K-nearest neighbors-based feature selection algorithm, to evaluate the features extracted from an induction motor dataset. The dataset contains data from eight different health states of an induction motor. Feature relevancy is calculated for each health state. The selected features are fed into a simple Bayesian binary classifier to calculate the most likely health state. The method provides insight into the relevance of features by sensor type and also by signal processing type. The evaluation of similarity among the selected features can help identify similar faults. The results obtained emphasize the importance of domain knowledge in the proper design of features.

Rather than the all-or-nothing approach to terminate all sessions identified as suspicious, the topology route traffic to different servers replicas with different monitoring intensity level based on their likelihood of attacks. This topology leverages recent advances in software-defined networking (SDN) to dynamically route such sessions into risk-appropriate computing environments. These environments offer enhanced training opportunities intrusion detection systems (IDSes) by exposing data streams that would not have been observable had the session merely been terminated at the first sign of maliciousness.

We assume that in the region endangered by the flood, there are several water reservoirs, each with a separate direction, economical goals, and protection subregion. Reservoirs on the same river may form subsystems with common goals. We investigate a frequent case where all reservoirs are situated on feeders while the flood wave on the recipient between and beneath the feeder mouths can be controlled by a coordinated release of water from the reservoirs. The reservoirs' own protection regions do not include the recipient's valley. Flood damage is minimized by a suitable dynamic multicriteria coordination with the environmental, financial and human life protection-related criteria. The coordinating decision center assures that the values of the individual reservoir criteria are non-dominated and belong to a given reference set. The latter can be interpreted as acceptable values of criteria on a certain subinterval of the control period. We provide an approach to finding a non-dominated trajectory of the overall reservoir system that fulfils the above coordinator's demands. We also describe the architecture of the decision support system capable of solving the coordination problem in real-time. A real-life example of finding a flood-control strategy for the reservoir system in the Upper Vistula basin in Poland will be presented.","","978-1-7281-0933-6","10.1109/MMAR.2019.8864657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8864657","multicriteria optimal control;decision support systems;temporal preferences;reference multifunction;water reservoir systems;flood control","Reservoirs;Floods;Rivers;Decision support systems;Trajectory;Real-time systems","floods;hydrological techniques;reservoirs;rivers","water reservoir systems;reference multifunction method;decision support system;optimal reservoir control strategies;flood emergency;water reservoirs;economical goals;protection subregion;frequent case;flood wave;feeder mouths;flood damage;suitable dynamic multicriteria coordination;environmental life protection-related criteria;financial life protection-related criteria;human life protection-related criteria;coordinating decision center;individual reservoir criteria;control period;reservoir system;coordination problem;flood-control strategy;river;Upper Vistula basin;Poland","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dot is an ultra-thin structure created using a material with strong crystalline cubic anisotropy. It is in-plane ordered with an effective fourfold anisotropy. In the case of the antivortex, we consider astroid-shaped dots, while in the case of the vortex, the circular dots and the astroid-shaped ones. Unlike in the soft-magnetic dots, the vortex (antivortex) textures in thin layers with sufficiently strong fourfold anisotropy consist of four closure domains independent of the dot shape. The magnetization in the domain walls (DWs) deviates from the dot plane under the action of the out-of-plane polarized electric current normal to the dot, which drives the DW propagation-a rotation of the texture around the vortex (antivortex) center. The DW velocity is dependent on the distance from the vortex (antivortex) core; thus, the DWs deform under the current creating a fourfold spiral shape. For sufficiently hard cubic magnets, we find a regime of the oscillatory dynamics of the dot [a cyclic switching between the spiral state and the closure-domain vortex (antivortex) state]. For softer magnets, we consider a spin-transfer-driven fast magnetization reversal of the vortex state mediated by the creation of the spiral state.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2017.2710308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937928","Magnetic domain wall (DW);magnetic vortex;spin-transfer oscillator","Magnetization;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Oscillators;Magnetic cores;Magnetic tunneling;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","magnetic anisotropy;magnetic domain walls;magnetic switching;magnetisation;magnetisation reversal;nanomagnetics;nanostructured materials;soft magnetic materials;spin polarised transport;vortices","softer magnets;vortex state;spin-transfer-driven dynamics;magnetic vortices;magnetization dynamics;antivortex-containing nanodot;out-of-plane polarized electric current;astroid-shaped dots;circular dots;soft-magnetic dots;oscillatory dynamics;magnetization reversal;magnetic antivortices;crystalline cubic anisotropy;domain walls","","1","34","Traditional","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Digitally intensive architectures and smart conversion algorithms are therefore the fuel of future ultra-low power (ULP) designs. The minimization of the output average bitrate is an effective way to maximize the system energy efficiency. Level-crossing-sampling (LC) ADCs are a class of converters that addresses such problem. In their conventional implementation, however, they are mainly impaired by analog blocks (i.e. the high-performance comparators), difficult to be designed in deep nanoscale CMOS. This paper describes a highly-digital frequency-domain implementation of a LC ADC, which replaces the analog comparators with an oscillator-based quantizer and simple digital logic. LC is performed in the digital frequency-domain, where the application of adaptive-resolution algorithms to further enhance power efficiency becomes straightforward. Behavioral modeling simulations demonstrate the appropriateness of the proposed topology by comparing it with the conventional designs and by evaluating the impact of the oscillator-based-quantizer nonidealities on the ADC performance.","","978-1-5386-0915-6","10.1109/EBCCSP.2017.8022825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022825","analog-to-digital converter;level-crossing-sampling;adaptive-resolution;VCO-based quantizer;frequency domain","Frequency-domain analysis;Quantization (signal);Radiation detectors;Signal resolution;CMOS technology;Topology;Semiconductor device modeling","analogue-digital conversion;CMOS integrated circuits;comparators (circuits);integrated circuit modelling","frequency-domain adaptive-resolution level-crossing-sampling ADC;analog-to-digital converters;system energy efficiency;analog comparators;oscillator-based quantizer;digital logic;oscillator-based-quantizer nonidealities","","1","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the results of research into the mechanism of leaks between stages in multi-stage magnetic fluid seals. The tests were conducted when the pressure of the sealing air increased and reached its maximum value. The influence of the magnetic fluid properties, such as saturation magnetization or dynamic viscosity, was taken into account. Studies were performed for different seal temperatures. Experiments allowed models for determining the maximum pressure of the multi-stage seal to be proposed, based on the information about this pressure for a one-stage seal.

In our previous work, we proposed a job placement algorithm based on a local migration process, which aims at reducing the internal fragmentation due to using a convex prism shape for job allocation. However, HPC systems are prone to suffer from external fragmentation as well. Hence, in this paper, we majorly strive to reduce the external fragmentation brought in by the job scheduling and placement processes. Firstly, from the job scheduling aspect of view, we propose a packing-based job scheduling strategy, which reduces the external fragmentation by using the First Come First Served + backfilling strategy. Secondly, we give a review of the migration-based job placement algorithm in our previous work. Thirdly, in order to reduce the external fragmentation resulting from running jobs scattered across the system, we propose a job placement reconfiguration algorithm, which uses a global migration process to rearrange the placement of the running jobs across the system. Both local and global migration are emulated virtual processes under the off-line scenario, which have no migration overhead. However, under the on-line scenario, migration is a real process and leads to a migration delay. Therefore, we propose a buffer-based on-line scheduling model, which helps to avoid the delay of local migration. The evaluation results validate the efficiency of our approach in reducing system fragmentation and improving system utilization.","","978-1-5386-0862-3","10.1109/ISPDC.2017.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8121617","Topology-aware;job placement;off-line;on-line;migration;packing-based job scheduling","Shape;Resource management;Delays;Schedules;Layout;Scheduling;Processor scheduling","parallel processing;resource allocation;scheduling","3D torus;HPC systems;topology-aware job scheduling;high performance computing systems;local migration process;internal fragmentation;job allocation;job placement reconfiguration algorithm;global migration process;on-line scheduling model;HPC","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We analyze the arising noncooperative game in which the attackers decide whether to continue a TRA when threatened and honest stations decide whether to start jamming when the TRA is continued.

The coupling is ensured by the Faraday's law of induction and it is unidirectional because the magnetic effect of the resultant eddy currents is neglected. The models we propose consider simplified geometries. However, the source coil in which an imposed current flows is described by a parametric curve, which can be of any shape.

Numerical results are compared with analytical ones and, aiming to quantify the uncertainties (UQ), the expression of the modeling error was determined.

It consists of 180 three-minutes long conversations in an arranged situation where the examined person was interviewing a non-native patient with a broken arm.In two experimental conditions, suggestions were made: to be polite, to be unemotional and in the control group there were no suggestions. Recordings were analyzed with voice quality and prosody parameterization methods as well as MFCC-GMM emotion recognition algorithm. The following observations for polite speech were made: in spite of similar F0, Canadians tend to modulate speech significantly more than Polish. The intonation was more flat and monotonous for Polish. No significant differences were found in voice timbre. For both, Polish and Canadians, polite speech took more time than in the no-suggestion condition, and the latter was also longer than unemotional condition. From the point of view of emotions in voice, higher proportion of sadness was detected in Polish than for Canadian group in all conditions, but the tendency is the strongest for polite condition.","","978-1-5386-8466-5","10.1109/TechSpo.2018.8584627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8584627","vocal politeness across cultures;social signal processing;emotion recognition;computational paralinguistics","Databases;Cultural differences;Feature extraction;Frequency measurement;Standards;Atmospheric measurements;Current measurement","cepstral analysis;emotion recognition;Gaussian processes;mixture models;natural language processing;speech processing;speech recognition","voice quality;prosody parameterization methods;MFCC-GMM emotion recognition algorithm;polite speech;polite condition;Canadian dialogues;acoustic correlates;speech POLAC;Politeness Across Cultures;Polish dialogues;intended politeness","","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If a peer pk receiving ej is not allowed to subscribe the topics of ei, the peer pk illegally obtains the information by receiving ej. In our previous studies, the SBS, TBS, and FS-H protocols are proposed to prevent illegal information flow. In addition, if a source peer pi publishes an event message e without giving related topics or with giving unrelated topics, a destination peer pj may misunderstand the meaning of the event message e. Here, malicious information flow occurs. In this paper, we newly propose a TBSM (topic-based synchronization to prevent malicious information flow) protocol.

This paper addresses the mobile manipulation problem from a real-time, closed loop perspective. In particular, we propose a generic optimization-based Cartesian controller, that given a continuous monitoring of the goal, determines the best motion commands. We target our controller to a robotic system comprising an arm and a mobile platform. However, the approach can in principle be extended to more complex mechanisms. The approach is based on shifting the problem to velocity space, where end effector velocity is a linear function of joint and base platform velocities. Our approach was quantitatively evaluated both on simulation and on a real service robot. It was also integrated into a mobile service robot architecture targeting domestic tasks and evaluated on the RoboCup@Home scientific competition.

While the configuration of highly resilient data planes is known to be a difficult combinatorial problem, over the last years, much progress has been made in the design of algorithms which provably guarantee connectivity even under many concurrent link failures. However, while these algorithms provide connectivity, the resulting routes after failures can be very long, which in turn can harm performance. In this paper, we propose, analyze, and evaluate methods for fast failover algorithms which account for the quality of the routes after failures, in addition to connectivity. In particular, we revisit the existing approach to cover the to-be-protected network with arc-disjoint spanning arborescences to define alternative routes to the destination, aiming to keep the stretch imposed by these trees low (hence the name of our method: Bonsai). We show that the underlying problem is NP-hard on general topologies and present lower bound results that are tight for various topologies, for any class of fast failover algorithms. We also present heuristics for general networks and demonstrate their performance benefits in extensive simulations. Finally, we show that failover algorithms using low-stretch arborescences, as a side effect, can provide connectivity under more general failure models than usually considered in the literature.","1530-0889","978-1-7281-0057-9","10.1109/DSN.2019.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809517","Networks;Failover;Local Fast Failover;Resilience","Routing;Network topology;Resilience;Communication networks;Topology;Heuristic algorithms;Focusing","computational complexity;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics)","combinatorial problem;NP-hard;general failure models;low-stretch arborescences;alternative routes;arc-disjoint spanning arborescences;fast failover algorithms;concurrent link failures;highly resilient data planes;control plane;data plane;modern communication networks;efficient fast failover routing;Bonsai","","1","72","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Dijkstra algorithm is a generalization of the breadth-first search, and we generalize the Dijkstra algorithm further to resolve the continuity and contiguity constraints of the frequency slot units required in EONs. Specifically, we generalize the notion of a label, change what we iterate with, and reformulate the edge relaxation so that vertices are revisited, loops avoided, and worse labels discarded. We also use the typical constriction during edge relaxation to take care of the signal modulation constraints. The algorithm can be used with various spectrum allocation policies.

Synaptic connections represent both the synaptic weights and expected delays between the network inputs. This property of synaptic connections facilitates recognition of time sequences and provides context-based associations between sequence elements. Characteristics of time delays are learned and are updated each time an input sequence is presented. There are no separate learning and testing modes typically used in other neural networks, as the network starts to predict the next input element as soon as there is no expected input signal. The network generates output signals useful for associative recall and prediction. These output signals depend on the presented input context and the knowledge stored in the graph. Such a mode of operation is preferred for the organization of episodic memories used to store the observed episodes and to recall them if a sufficient context is provided. The associative sequential recall is useful for the operation of working memory in a cognitive agent. Test results demonstrate that the network correctly recognizes the input sequences with variable delays and that it is more efficient than other recently developed sequential memory networks based on associative neurons.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2921143","National Science Centre, Poland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8759911","Associative knowledge graphs;associative memories;synaptic delays;synaptic efficacy","Neurons;Logic gates;Delays;Organizations;Biological neural networks;Memory management;Delay effects","associative processing;cognitive systems;content-addressable storage;learning (artificial intelligence);self-organising feature maps","associative memories;synaptic delays;self-organizing neural network;time delays;time sequence recognition;context-based associations;associative recall;episodic memories;associative sequential recall;associative neurons;sequential memory networks;cognitive agent","","","29","IEEE","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the smoothing parameter is separately calculated for each dimension by means of the plug-in method. The classification qualities of the reduced and full structure PNN are compared. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of PNN, for which global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and the common reduction methods are applied, both in the input layer and the pattern layer.

The connection between the superconducting magnet and the cold by-pass diode is made through a clamping system called “half-moon,” located at the lowest point of the cold-masses. This area is prone to receiving metallic debris residual from the assembly technological processes. The metallic debris might move and create an earth fault during helium flows that occur not only during the cool-down, warm-up, and flushing of the cryogenic installation but also during magnet quenches at high currents. In case of appearance, the earth fault is detected by the protection system of the circuit and as a consequence, the current is ramped down to zero. Subsequently, with the circuit current already at zero, the fault can be eliminated using a device denominated as the Earth Fault Burner. The fault elimination must follow a strict procedure as it is not fully risk-free. This paper describes the details of such earth fault elimination, including preliminary diagnostics and necessary hardware. Two examples from the LHC operation are described and discussed.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2017.2773268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8106785","Superconducting circuit quality assurance;earth fault;high voltage qualification;fault localization;fault elimination;capacitors;cable insulation;measurement techniques","Circuit faults;Superconducting magnets;Magnetic circuits;Helium;Large Hadron Collider;Electronic mail;Voltage measurement","accelerator magnets;cryogenics;helium;superconducting magnets","helium flows;magnet quenches;circuit current;earth fault elimination;LHC operation;LHC main dipole circuits;superconducting dipole magnets;superfluid helium bath;magnet quench protection system;clamping system;cold-masses;metallic debris residual;assembly technological processes;large hadron collider;earth fault burner;cold by-pass diode;cryogenic installation;temperature 1.9 K;He","","2","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, instead of a single pixel intensity, cumulative sums of intensities in patches of various size around each pixel are computed. Thanks to this the method is less sensitive to spurious variations in video and, in result, it is more insensitive to false positives. The second modification is the background detection inference rule, which we propose to base on the modified median absolute variation analysis. This rule further avoids false positives and does not depend on sensitive thresholds. We show that the proposed method has better accuracy than the classical median method, as well as it favorably compares to the group of subspace based background subtraction methods.

Objectives: To develop a system for extracorporeal stimulation of sacral nerve roots. Methods: Dedicated software controlled a ten-electrode stimulation array by switching between different electrode configurations and current levels. A built-in impedance and current level measurement assessed the effectiveness of current injection. Intra-anal surface electromyography (sEMG) informed on targeting the sacral nerve roots. All tests were performed on five pig specimens. Results: During switching between electrode configurations, the system delivered 100% of the set current (25 mA, 30 Hz, 200 μs cathodic pulses) in 93% of 250 stimulation trains across all specimens. The impedance measured between single stimulation array contacts and corresponding anodes across all electrode configurations and specimens equaled 3.7 ± 2.5 kΩ. The intra-anal sEMG recorded a signal amplitude increase as previously observed in the literature. When the stimulation amplitude was tested in the range from 1 to 21 mA using the interconnected contacts of the stimulation array and the intra-anal anode, the impedance remained below 250 Ω and the system delivered 100% of the set current in all cases. Intra-anal sEMG showed an amplitude increase for current levels exceeding 6 mA. Conclusion: The system delivered stable electric current, which was proved by built-in impedance and current level measurements. Intra-anal sEMG confirmed the ability to target the branches of the autonomous nervous system originating from the sacral nerve roots. Significance: Stimulation outside of the operative field during rectal cancer surgery is feasible and may improve the practicality of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2017.2703951","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7927474","Autonomic nerve sparing;extracorporeal stimulation;pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring;surface electromyography;total mesorectal excision","Electrodes;Software;Surgery;Impedance;Biomedical measurement;Monitoring;Cancer","bioelectric potentials;biological organs;biomedical electrodes;cancer;electromyography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;surgery","extracorporeal stimulation;sacral nerve roots;pelvic autonomic nerve integrity;rectal cancer surgery;ten-electrode stimulation array;different electrode configurations;current level measurement;current injection;intra-anal surface electromyography;single stimulation array contacts;intra-anal sEMG;intra-anal anode;autonomous nervous system;autonomic nerve sparing;impedance measurement;pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring;current 1.0 mA to 21.0 mA;current 25.0 mA;frequency 30.0 Hz;time 200 mus","","1","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reduction of the arc erosion in the analyzed electromechanical switches was achieved through an application of the hybrid switching in the tested alternative current circuit during interruption of the inductive current. The presented method is based on a commutation of the current during its interruption into a semiconductor branch that is connected in parallel to the operated switch. Thus, this approach is able to limit the electric arc energy efficiently, and as a consequence the arc erosion of the electrical contacts is also significantly reduced. For this reason, the application of the hybrid switching has a positive influence on a lifespan and a reliability of the operated switch. In order to evaluate the influence of the hybrid switching application on an effectiveness of the limitation of the arc erosion in the analyzed LV switches, 50 000 current interruptions were conducted in the tested circuit by each of four analyzed switches. Researches were performed for two standalone switches during a standard current interruption, as well as, for two switches with applied the hybrid switching system. In order to compare the arc erosion of the contact surfaces in both considered cases, scanning electron microscope method coupled with energy dispersion spectroscopy was applied. Moreover, photos of the electric contact surfaces are presented.

"The Loss of Continuity in a Liquid Ring Formed by a Magnetic Fluid","M. Szczęch","AGH University of Science and Technology, Kraków, Poland","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","","2019","55","9","1","8","A magnetic fluid ring, which can be compared to a liquid O-ring, held at a given place by a magnetic field is used for various applications, such as seals, compressors, dampers, or sensors. The work of this type of system is the result of a number of factors, such as the distribution and magnitude of the magnetic field in the gap, rheological and magnetic properties, physical properties of the surrounding environment (interfacial phenomena) and operating conditions (differential pressure and relative velocity). The research area of this publication is related to the recognition and assessment of how the magnetic fluid properties influence the mechanism of the local loss of continuity for a single liquid ring. This applies to the case when the differential pressure on two sides of the magnetic fluid-free surface exceeds a critical value and a leak channel is formed. Previous studies have shown that the process of equalizing the pressure difference in this type of system is related to pressure jumps. This phenomenon has not been linked to such properties as saturation magnetization, dynamic viscosity or surface tension. This paper takes these factors into account. In addition, the shape of the stage (trapezoid and rectangle) on which the fluid is held and the magnetic field value are considered. The loss of continuity is an important issue and the obtained results allow this problem to be better understood and the magnetic fluid to be chosen for appropriate working conditions, e.g., in the case of multistage seals. The studied phenomenon may also contribute to the development of new types of pressure regulators or sensors.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2019.2916322","Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza im.

However, the image reconstruction algorithms needed to correct the subsampling artifacts affect the nature of noise, i.e., it becomes non-stationary. Some methods have been proposed in the literature dealing with the non-stationary noise in pMRI. However, their performance depends on information not usually available such as multiple acquisitions, receiver noise matrices, sensitivity coil profiles, reconstruction coefficients, or even biophysical models of the data. Besides, some methods show an undesirable granular pattern on the estimates as a side effect of local estimation. Finally, some methods make strong assumptions that just hold in the case of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which limits their usability in real scenarios. We propose a new automatic noise estimation technique for non-stationary Rician noise that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. Its effectiveness is due to the derivation of a variance-stabilizing transformation designed to deal with any SNR. The method was compared to the main state-of-the-art methods in synthetic and real scenarios.

In this case, due to a common physiological background it is particularly difficult to recognize the measured object and the unwanted activity of neighboring organs. This paper presents a method to discriminate the source of such physiological noise based on analysis of complex-valued time-frequency representation of a multilead record. The method uses a dual-tree pyramid decomposition and the polar transform to produce magnitude and phase values of high scale details. These details are inspected for coinciding patterns -the cross-correlation function separates the physiological source of noise with consistent phase shift and the circuitry noise with random phase shift. Based on magnitude ratio and phase delay, a triangular method indicates the most probable position of the noise source. The proposed method was implemented and tested with a simplified model of thorax and various real ECG records. Our results show that the position of noise source can be determined with an accuracy of order of 10% of the thorax diameter, what is sufficient to unambiguously indicate the active organ.","","978-1-7281-1715-7","10.1109/SPS.2019.8882036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882036","noise;multilead record;electrocardiography","Physiology;Electrocardiography;Transforms;Thorax;Electrodes;Correlation;Delays","correlation methods;electrocardiography;medical signal detection;signal representation;source separation;time-frequency analysis;transforms;trees (mathematics)","polar transform;ECG records;noise source;random phase shift;circuitry noise;cross-correlation function;dual-tree pyramid decomposition;complex-valued time-frequency representation;physiological noise;physiological background;living tissue;electrical activity;multilead ECG record;physiological source","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The more personal matters like mails, pictures, social contacts, financial accounts, political attitudes etc. are channeled via the internet or social media, the more doors are opened to surveillance or intrusion into privacy from various sides. Reactions to this condition are diverse. The trailblazers of the internet age, on the one hand, propose a post-privacy doctrine according to which the unlimited possibilities of the web open unknown freedoms, which should not be hampered by old-fashioned privacy concerns. Critics like Evgeny Morozov, on the other hand, see a dark time coming in which a reckless consumerism paves the way to authoritarian tendencies, a loss not only of privacy but also of freedom. This paper will discuss the post-privacy doctrine with reference to Paul Bernal's concept of a symbiotic relation between internet firms and customers. It will be argued, that this relation is asymmetric and therefore requires political regulation.","","978-1-5386-2365-7","10.1109/BESC.2017.8256407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8256407","Right to Privacy;Symbiotic Web;Customer Profiling;Algorithmic Discrimination;National Security Interests;State-Corporation Symbiosis;‘Splinternet’;EU-privacy Legislation","Privacy;Symbiosis;Facebook;Software;Companies;Europe","business data processing;data privacy;Internet;politics;socio-economic effects","post-privacy doctrine;internet firms;web-mediated communication;social contacts;web open unknown freedoms;privacy concerns;reckless consumerism;authoritarian tendencies;firm asymmetric symbiosis;liberal societies;political regulation","","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to analyze local field values in the entire GIS geometry, the full-Maxwell approach needs to be involved for simulating the VFT generation process. According to power substation layout studies, 90°-angled GIS disconnectors are often used in GIS projects, since they offer most layout options and, at the same time, require the lowest number of GIS components. This implies that the test setups are asymmetric, thus the direct use of the full-Maxwell approach requires 3-D models, the application of which is considered to be highly demanding from a numerical point of view. The paper shows a comparison of the results obtained from full-Maxwell numerical simulations for a development test setup of 1100 kV GIS. The analyses are conducted for full 3-D geometry and for the corresponding 2-Daxisymmetric geometry. Example simulations of the VFT overvoltage (VFTO) waveforms are presented for both geometries, together with a comparison of the numerical effort needed for solving the associated field equations. The presented approach based on the 2-D-axisymmetric GIS model allows one to significantly reduce the numerical effort involved to support design work and development tests.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2016.2527823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414503","Full-Maxwell wave analysis;gas-insulated switchgear (GIS);very fast transients (VFTs)","Gas insulation;Geometry;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Numerical models;Three-dimensional displays;Sparks","gas insulated switchgear;numerical analysis","very fast transient;3D axisymmetric model;2D axisymmetric model;gas-insulated switchgear disconnector;GIS disconnector switching operation;VFT generation;full-Maxwell numerical simulation;voltage 1100 kV","","4","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study we present feasibility of the local phase velocity based imaging (LPVI) method to create images of phase velocity and viscoelastic parameters in viscoelastic tissue-mimicking materials and soft tissues. In viscoelastic materials it is necessary to utilize wave mode isolation using a narrow bandpass filter combined with a directional filter in order to robustly reconstruct phase velocity images with LPVI in viscoelastic media over a wide range of frequencies. A pair of sequential focused acoustic radiation force push beams, focused once on the left side and once on the right side of the probe, was used to produce broadband propagating shear waves. The local shear wave phase velocity is then recovered in the frequency domain for multiple frequencies, for both acquired data sets. Then, a two-dimensional shear wave velocity map is reconstructed by combining maps from two separate acquisitions. By testing the method on simulated data sets and performing in vitro phantom and in vivo liver tissue experiments, we show the ability of the proposed technique to generate shear wave phase velocity maps at various frequencies in viscoelastic materials. Moreover, a nonlinear least-squares problem is solved in order to locally estimate elasticity and viscosity parameters. The LPVI method with added directional and wavenumber filters can produce phase velocity images, which can be used to characterize viscoelastic materials.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2968147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8963899","Shear wave elastography (SWE);ultrasound;soft tissue;phantom;inclusion;local wavenumber;viscoelastic;phase velocity;acoustic radiation force;Kelvin-Voigt model;imaging","Liver;Velocity measurement;Imaging;Elasticity;Frequency-domain analysis;Acoustics","","","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In a single objective optimization the positions of switches are selected to minimize a selected objective function; for example SAIDI, SAIFI or AENS. Minimization of one of the objective functions is usually not equivalent to the minimization of other ones. In this work, a multiobjective optimization problem of the optimal switch allocation in radial distribution networks is considered. Three methods to solve this problem are studied: the exhaustive search method, the evolutionary computations based approach and the tree structure based algorithm. Distribution networks of various sizes with a radial topology and a single feeder are used to compare the methods in terms of the computation time and the accuracy of the results. It is shown that the tree structure based algorithm outperforms other approaches.","2378-8542","978-1-7281-3520-5","10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2019.8881742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8881742","distribution network reliability;SAIDI;SAIFI;AENS;multiobjective optimization","Switches;Linear programming;Optimization;Resource management;Evolutionary computation;Indexes;Minimization","evolutionary computation;failure analysis;power distribution reliability;search problems;trees (mathematics)","evolutionary computations;radial topology;tree structure based algorithm;exhaustive search method;optimal switch allocation;multiobjective optimization problem;selected objective function;power networks;radial distribution networks","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research shows that direct frequency domain linear ICI approximation, represented by the frequency domain model 2, offers good accuracy in term of ICI synthesis for the most practical Doppler frequencies and simultaneously requires less operations if the number of simulated UEs is large.","2326-0319","978-83-62065-30-1","10.23919/SPA.2017.8166898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8166898","OFDM;Multipath channels;Simulation","Frequency-domain analysis;OFDM;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Long Term Evolution;Fading channels;Time-domain analysis","3G mobile communication;approximation theory;fading channels;Fourier transforms;frequency division multiple access;frequency-domain analysis;intercarrier interference;interference suppression;Long Term Evolution;multipath channels;OFDM modulation;radio access networks;software radio","multipath fading channel;intercarrier interference;mathematical analysis;ICI phenomenon;3GPP Long Term Evolution standard;frequency domain models;time domain approach;direct frequency domain;ICI approximation;practical Doppler frequencies;performance analysis;multiUE E-UTRAN fading channel;multiple independent multipath fading radio channels;user equipment software;multiUE software defined evolved universal terrestrial radio access network traffic generator;digital Fourier transform based frequency domain simulation models;orthogonal frequency division multiple access schemes;Big O notation;direct frequency domain linear ICI approximation;simulated UE;3GPP compliant method","","1","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Drezewski","Department of Computer Science, AGH University of Science and Technology, Kraków, Poland","2018 International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Informatics (SAIN)","","2018","","","210","215","The agent-based approach to modeling and simulation (ABMS) has recently become very popular, especially among researchers dealing with biological and social simulations. The ABMS approach allows for modeling complex phenomena, resulting from interactions between many individuals, in a very natural way. The agent-based approach is especially useful when it comes to simulating emergent phenomena, which usually arise from interactions between a large number of individuals, each of which acts according to some simple patterns or rules. In this paper, two agent-based models of species formation processes are presented and experimentally verified. The first one is a model in which speciation takes places as a result of geographic barriers that split the population. In the second the speciation results from existence and interactions between flocks of individuals, which presence restricts mating between individuals from the same species. During experiments, the ecosystem diversity and the number of existing species are measured using entropy-based indicators.","","978-1-5386-5280-0","10.1109/SAIN.2018.8673368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673368","agent-based modeling and simulation;speciation;population diversity;entropy-based diversity measures","Biological system modeling;Multi-agent systems;Computational modeling;Sociology;Statistics;Informatics","biology computing;ecology;entropy;multi-agent systems","agent-based models;ecosystem diversity;entropy-based indicators;modeling simulation;biological simulations;social simulations;ABMS approach","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We analyze how the choice of direction of moving points influences the error for fitting to the data. Moreover, we derive the generalization bound with Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension for SVML. The experiments on synthetic and real world data sets show that SVML is better in fitting to the data than one-class support vector machines (OCSVM) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) with statistical significance for OCSVM.

Stator faults, bearing faults, or rotor faults can lead to unplanned downtime with associated cost and safety implications. Different sensors may be used to monitor the health state of induction motors with each sensor typically being better suited for diagnosing different faults. Condition monitoring approaches that fuse data from multiple sensors have the potential to diagnose a greater number of faults. In this paper, a sensor fusion approach based on the combination of a two-stage Bayesian method and principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed for diagnosing both electrical and mechanical faults in induction motors. Acoustic, electric, and vibration signals are gathered from motors operating under different loading conditions and health states. The inclusion of the PCA step ensures robustness to varying loading conditions.

The converter creates seven levels of output voltage utilizing three capacitors in a dc-link. Under the standard PWM technique such a converter may not operate properly due to unequal discharge of dc-link capacitors. In this paper new concepts of modulation are proposed to achieve more symmetrical discharging of the capacitors and to create the conditions for natural dc-link voltage balance. The natural balancing in the four level converter is a novel achievement and significantly differs from the situation with regard to three-level topology. The paper proposes the concept that the modulation patterns are different for particular levels. In the unbalanced state the output voltage triggers a unique component in the output current which when flowing via the dc-link capacitors varies their average voltages. A proof of this mechanism is also demonstrated in this paper.

However, configuring FRR mechanisms to tolerate multiple failures poses challenging algorithmic problems. While state-of-the-art solutions leveraging arc-disjoint arborescence-based network decompositions ensure that failover routes always reach their destinations eventually, even under multiple concurrent failures, these routes may be long and introduce unnecessary loads; moreover, they are tailored to worst-case failure scenarios. This paper presents an algorithmic framework for improving a given FRR network decomposition, using postprocessing. In particular, our framework is based on iterative arc swapping strategies and supports a number of use cases, from strengthening the resilience (e.g., in the presence of shared risk link groups) to improving the quality of the resulting routes (e.g., reducing route lengths and induced loads). Our simulations show that postprocessing is indeed beneficial in various scenarios, and can therefore enhance today's approaches.","2575-8462","978-1-7281-4222-7","10.1109/SRDS47363.2019.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9049550","Fast rerouting;FRR;fault tolerance;postprocessing;arborescence","","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","arc-disjoint arborescence-based network decompositions;multiple concurrent failures;failure scenarios;iterative arc swapping strategies;shared risk link groups;fast rerouting;fast traffic recovery;mission critical services;FRR network decomposition;failover routing","","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For larger kidney stones a percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the first line treatment. The procedure begins with a percutaneus puncture of the kidney to gain an access to intrarenal part of urinary tract, where the stone is located. Needle must reach precisely the targeted spot, passing through retroperitoneal cavity and kidney parenchyma without collision with adjacent organs or larger intrarenal blood vessels. In this paper, an algorithm dedicated for kidney arterial system segmentation is proposed. For validation, its' results were compared with manual segmentations of ten exemplary 3D images providing satisfactory outcomes. The effectiveness and reliability of this algorithm was also demonstrated by incorporating its results into 3D anatomical model prepared as an image-guidance for real PCNL procedure. The description of the proposed algorithm and methodology of the construction of aforementioned model is presented in this paper. It consists of a registration of different phases of CT images together with segmentation of particular structures of interest (kidney, stones, urinary tract, kidney vasculature). The proposed solution allows to obtain 3D patient-specific models in a far more efficient manner than manually or by the use of semiautomated methods giving excellent and reliable visualization of intrarenal structures and by thus can stand clinically useful add in preoperative planning and intraoperative support in minimally invasive urological interventions.","1558-2809","978-1-5386-6628-9","10.1109/IST.2018.8577147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8577147","intrarenal vessels segmentation;image guidance;percutaneous nephrolithotomy;preoperative planning;personalized surgery;kidney","Kidney;Image segmentation;Arteries;Three-dimensional displays;Computed tomography;Planning;Biomedical imaging","blood vessels;computerised tomography;diseases;image registration;image segmentation;kidney;medical image processing;needles;physiological models;surgery","renal vessels segmentation;preoperative planning;percutaneous nephrolithotomy;percutaneus puncture;intrarenal part;urinary tract;targeted spot;retroperitoneal cavity;adjacent organs;kidney arterial system segmentation;manual segmentations;exemplary 3D images;3D anatomical model;image-guidance;PCNL procedure;CT images;kidney vasculature;3D patient-specific models;intrarenal structures;kidney stones;kidney parenchyma;intrarenal blood vessels;minimally invasive urological interventions","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This management mechanism minimizes traffic transfer costs on inter-domain links. It works for volume and 95th percentile tariffs. DTM reacts dynamically to traffic changes on inter-domain links shifting some part of traffic (manageable traffic) from one link to another. The management mechanism works in a distributed way. It requires cooperation between operators, namely Internet Service Providers (ISPs), receiving and generating traffic. Communication between ISPs is realized by SDN controllers (interdomain SDN). DTM has been applied to inter-cloud communication for Data Centers (DCs) located in different ISP domains. Moreover, it is cloud-agnostic, i.e., DTM does not engage Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) into management procedures. Evaluation performed in the testbed shows that DTM is capable of decreasing ISP costs of transit traffic up to 29%.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.2986957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9062577","Network Management;Cost Optimization;Inter-Domain SDN;SD-WAN;Inter-SDN Communication;Inter-Cloud Communication;Inter-DC Communication","Cloud computing;Optimization;Data centers;Web and internet services;Measurement;Servers;Prediction algorithms","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This is due to the existence of trajectories which spend arbitrarily long time in a neighborhood of the equilibrium. In this work, a method to find enclosures of trajectories passing arbitrarily close to an unstable fixed point of spiral type is presented.

The authors align point clouds in every pair of frames by calculating the minimal sum of squared distances between the corresponding joints. A point cloud distance measure with temporal context has been utilised in k-nearest neighbours algorithm to compare time instants of motion sequences. To enhance the generalisation of the recognition and to shorten the processing time, for every individual a single multidimensional time series among several multidimensional time series describing the individual's gait is established. The correct classification rate has been determined on the basis of a real dataset of human gait. It contains 230 gait cycles of 22 subjects.

Such traffic remapping attacks (TRAs) are cheap to launch, impossible to prevent, hard to detect, and harmful to non-selfish nodes. While studied mostly in single-hop wireless network settings, TRAs have resisted analysis in multi-hop settings. In his paper we offer a game-theoretic approach: we derive a formal model of opportunistic TRAs, define a TRA game with a heuristic rank-based payoff function, and propose a boundedly rational multistage attack strategy that both selfish and non-selfish nodes are free to use. Thus non- selfish nodes are allowed to respond in kind to selfish ones. We characterize the form of equilibrium that the multistage play reaches and verify via simulation that it often coincides with a Nash equilibrium in which harmful TRAs are curbed in the first place, whereas harmless ones need not be.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8253959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8253959","","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Spread spectrum communication;Games;Topology;Software","ad hoc networks;game theory;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels","nonselfish nodes;multihop ad hoc network;single-hop wireless network settings;boundedly rational multistage attack strategy;traffic remapping attack game modelling;opportunistic TRA game;quality of service;QoS;heuristic rank-based payoff function;Nash equilibrium","","1","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Present-day devices produce limited vision, in part due to indiscriminate and simultaneous activation of many RGCs of different types that normally signal asynchronously. To improve artificial vision, we propose a closed-loop, cellular-resolution device that automatically identifies the types and properties of nearby RGCs, calibrates its stimulation to produce a dictionary of achievable RGC activity patterns, and then uses this dictionary to optimize stimulation patterns based on the incoming visual image. To test this concept, we use a high-density multi-electrode array as a lab prototype, and deliver a rapid sequence of electrical stimuli from the dictionary, progressively assembling a visual image within the visual integration time of the brain. Greedily minimizing the error between the visual stimulus and a linear reconstruction (as a surrogate for perception) yields a real-time algorithm with an efficiency of 96% relative to optimum. This framework also provides insights for developing efficient hardware. For example, using only the most effective 50% of electrodes minimally affects performance, suggesting that an adaptive device configured using measured properties of the patient's retina may permit efficiency with accuracy.","1948-3554","978-1-5386-7921-0","10.1109/NER.2019.8716987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8716987","","Visualization;Dictionaries;Image reconstruction;Retina;Electrical stimulation;Electrodes;Greedy algorithms","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical electrodes;brain;cellular biophysics;eye;neurophysiology;prosthetics;visual perception","nearby RGCs;dictionary;achievable RGC activity patterns;stimulation patterns;incoming visual image;high-density multielectrode array;lab prototype;rapid sequence;electrical stimuli;visual integration time;brain;visual stimulus;real-time algorithm;adaptive device;electrical stimulation;high-fidelity artificial retina;retinal prostheses;visual perception;photoreceptor degeneration;stimulating surviving retinal ganglion cells;artificial visual signals;present-day devices;simultaneous activation;artificial vision;closed-loop;cellular-resolution device;properties","","1","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During long term PD exposure, discharges develop inside channels within a void, leading to a variation in the discharge area on the void wall as well as a clustering effect. In this paper, the development of a method for identifying localized changes in the dielectric structure, through the detection of dispersed channels with reduced resistivity which occur due to multichannel discharges, is described. Discharge spots in selected ranges of surface resistivity, occurring due to the energetic impact of PD, are mapped. This mapping shows both the distribution of local centers on the surface of the specimen, characterized by a reduced value of surface resistivity. Furthermore, during aging tests this surface resistivity exhibited a progressive reduction by four orders of magnitude, justifying the occurrence of an effective discharge area in the void source. This additionally impacts PD pattern modulation and can be a possible initiation of the formation of cross channels in the bulk isolation which, in the long term, can lead to complete discharge.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2018.007426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8561327","partial discharge mechanism;discharge channels distribution;void surface conductivity","Partial discharges;Discharges (electric);Conductivity;Surface discharges;Surface morphology;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness","ageing;discharges (electric);partial discharge measurement;partial discharges;surface resistance;voids (solid)","long term PD exposure;discharges;void wall;clustering effect;dispersed channels;reduced resistivity;discharge spots;surface resistivity;effective discharge area;void source;PD pattern modulation;cross channels;complete discharge;discharge channels;effective partial discharge area;partial discharge dynamics;dielectric structure;multichannel discharges;aging tests","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Another performance measure introduced in this paper - incremental feature significance - determines the level of improvement that results from selecting only some features, which were added to the existing features, rather than replacing one set of features with another. In both cases, we can also estimate the number of features saved by replacing the original features with the selected ones for which recognition levels improve.

It is envisioned that this optimization will be achieved through advanced network orchestration functionalities. Video streaming accounts for the vast majority of mobile traffic, hence optimizing performance and Quality of Experience (QoE) for video traffic becomes crucial for the next generation (5G) mobile networks. In this paper, we focus on video streaming applications based on MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP), a technology that dynamically adapts to changing network conditions by requesting content in chunks encoded at different bitrates, and which is used by major streaming services like Netflix and YouTube. The adaptation process of DASH clients may be speeded up by using the recently standardized MPEG-DASH SAND (Server and Network-assisted DASH) protocol, which envisions the presence of a DANE (DASH-Aware Network Element) in the network providing real-time network bandwidth information to DASH clients. However, when DASH clients do not request the content at the bitrate recommended by the DANE, i.e. they ignore SAND messages or purposely request content at higher bitrates, bandwidth may end up being used in suboptimal way and end users will likely end up receiving poor playback experience, especially on shared bottlenecks. In this paper, we address this issue by combining SAND with network orchestration, where we use advanced SDN (Software Defined Networking) capabilities to have the network enforce the bandwidths selected by the DANE for each individual DASH client, and we demonstrate this concept in the state of the art 5G testbed of the H2020 TRIANGLE project.","2472-8144","978-1-5386-8336-1","10.1109/ICIN.2019.8685911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685911","5G;DASH;DANE;SAND;SDN;QoE;MANO","Bit rate;Quality of experience;Bandwidth;Streaming media;5G mobile communication;Servers;Transform coding","5G mobile communication;hypermedia;Internet;quality of experience;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming","next generation mobile networks;bitrates;standardized MPEG-DASH SAND;Aware Network Element;5G testbed;individual DASH client;Software Defined Networking;advanced SDN capabilities;real-time network bandwidth information;DANE;Network-assisted DASH;DASH clients;adaptation process;streaming services;network conditions;Dynamic Adaptive Streaming;video streaming applications;video traffic;QoE;mobile traffic;advanced network orchestration functionalities;vertical industries;single network platform;controllable video","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because these values are permanent, the attackers can modify and abuse that. To overcome this problem, many researchers would like to use dynamic bio-information, e.g., electrocardiograms (ECG), in security systems. In this case, a sensor in the system must measure the dynamic bio-information instead. The difficulty is that usually, the measured data is different whenever it measures. Therefore if the data is applied to existing algorithms, the results will not be matched and the user will be rejected to pass. This is because an unstable base point, which are Q and S values in the ECG, is used to calculate. To solve this, it suggests an adjusted (Qi * Si) algorithm that defines a specific distance from the location of R-peak to obtain the Qi and Si values. The algorithm can use balanced input data to determine the features, thereby enabling a highly accurate dynamic biometric system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903575","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8664673","Adjusted (Qᵢ * Sᵢ);electrocardiogram (ECG);personal identification;QRS complex","Silicon;Electrocardiography;Security;Heuristic algorithms;Time-domain analysis;Training;Feature extraction","biometrics (access control);electrocardiography;fingerprint identification;least squares approximations","ECG-based personal identification;dynamic biometric system;static bioinformation;dynamic bioinformation;biometric information;personal identification study;security systems","","1","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These can be defined by the client contracting the study or the core experts employed by the Delphi supplier, usually a consulting or research institution. The questions can have various forms: binary (""yes/no""), qualitative - Likert-scale-valued, or quantitative. A flexible survey system should offer a variety of question and/or statement types, as well as a user-friendly interface to reply or verify them. Additionally, the replies should be analyzed by strict statistical and uncertainty handling methods to yield consistent recommendations to the survey stakeholders. The `decision Delphi' is a survey variant that corresponds most strictly to the needs of organizations that look for expert knowledge concerning specific technological, market or other business problems. This type of survey also fits the needs of medical research on future therapy, epidemics, health care issues, etc. Its characteristic feature is the participation of the client's staff or the decision makers themselves. The cloud-based application ForgnosisTM is a modern implementation of a decision Delphi endowed with sophisticated analytic features. We will present its capabilities based on a recent survey and analysis case carried out for the EU Horizon 2020 flagship project MOVING. This system is offered in SaaS mode, with some PaaS functionalities. The latter include a variety of programming tools for designing the organization's customized survey.","","978-1-5386-1326-9","10.1109/SOCA.2017.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8241542","online Delphi survey; corporate foresight; multi-round decision Delphi; statistical analysis; group decision support; strategic decision making; echnological scenarios","Statistical analysis;Market research;Software as a service;Stakeholders;Forecasting;Organizations","cloud computing;decision making;decision support systems;forecasting theory;uncertainty handling;user interfaces","Delphi survey;cloud-based decision support service;online Delphi method;multiple round interviews;expert group;structured e-survey;Delphi statements;Delphi supplier;Likert-scale;flexible survey system;user-friendly interface;expert knowledge;medical research;statistical uncertainty;uncertainty handling","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, democratic societies elect parliaments, judges in competitions choose finalists, companies choose their advisory boards. In this talk we argue that such settings can be modeled in the language of multiwinner elections. Specifically, in a multiwinner election we are given a set of candidates, a set of voters (with preferences over the candidates), and a target committee size. The goal is to choose a subset of candidates of a given size, in a way that is most satisfying for the voters. We show that exact meaning of the phrase “most satisfying” strongly depends on the context, but we argue that the language of committee scoring rules is sufficiently rich to capture many interesting interpretations of this phrase.","","978-1-5386-2365-7","10.1109/BESC.2017.8256353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8256353","multiwinner elections;committee scoring rules;complexity;axioms","Voting;Companies;Urban areas;Computer science;Economics;Indexes;Complexity theory","behavioural sciences computing;social sciences computing","invited presentation;International Conference;numerous situations;democratic societies;parliaments;judges;advisory boards;multiwinner election;target committee size;committee scoring rules;agents preferences;Behavioral Economic and Socio-Cultural Computing;BESC","","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When approaching reference values, this preference requirement results in solving an equivalent second-level scalar optimization problem with a certain distance measure to be minimized. In a situation where the reference set contains values to be avoided within the solution process, distance maximization with respect to this set is a natural technique. The reference sets may arise as relaxed criteria space constraints and are non-precisely defined. Therefore, we provide sufficient conditions ensuring the stability of solutions with respect to reference set perturbations. For various reasons, including trajectory safety, the above problem may be particularly relevant in the case of avoidance values, which are usually defined with a native uncertainty. We propose a sensitivity analysis method based on investigating the properties of attainable criteria values minimizing the distance to perturbed reference sets. Two problems of this kind are formulated and solved. An application to selecting compromise trajectories in multicriteria optimal control with two reference multifunctions is outlined in the final part of this paper.","","978-1-5386-4325-9","10.1109/MMAR.2018.8486062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486062","multicriteria optimization;reference sets;sensitivity analysis;distance maximization;reference multifunction","Optimization;Sensitivity;Trajectory;Optimal control;Reservoirs;Minimization;Stability criteria","operations research;optimisation;perturbation techniques;sensitivity analysis;set theory","distance measure;distance maximization;reference set perturbations;sensitivity analysis method;multicriteria optimal control;avoidance solutions;multicriteria optimization;scalar optimization problem;criteria space constraints;least-distance solutions;distance scalarizing solutions;stability;trajectory safety;uncertainty","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several methods were developed to assure that feature, with LIME and SHAP among most robust approaches.
